Show,Sentiment,Review
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit works because it isn't only about the Watergate break-in - in the show, it occurs as early as in Episode 2 - but also about the people whose lives and careers were made or unmade by the scandal."
Losing Alice,1,"It's a thoroughly engaging yet enigmatic Hitchcockian thriller that likes to toy with the audience, revealing its storyline teasingly through flashbacks, flash-forwards and films-within-the-show."
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good is at its best when it sets its sights on bigger fish, such as cultural identity and our current obsession with labelling each other."
The Gilded Age,1,"It's perfectly watchable, and every intention and motive is signposted with Fellowes's usual clarity... But solid gold this is not."
The Twilight Zone,0,"Ultimately, this Twilight Zone suffers by comparison, because there is just so much to compare it with - Serling's still peerless original, Jordan Peele's movies, other sci-fi anthology series such as Black Mirror and now TZ's own first season."
WandaVision,1,"As expected, the production values are excellent, and the writing is solid, even cheeky at moments, and witty."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Everett is why Sam is so wonderful to be around. Shes funny, she cares about people, and she can belt out a Janis Joplin song like its nobodys business."
Home Before Dark,1,"Home Before Dark deserves more seasons, for the magic and mystery it crafts but also because of a cast that gives their all to a story that pulls out all the stops."
Archive 81,1,This anxiety-inducing series continues to build on the mystery in a way that keeps you wanting more.
Pieces of Her,1,"On the face of it, it seems as though Collette as Laura is under-acting, portraying her character poorly, with not enough emotion. But really the opposite is true."
Hellbound,1,"Where it gets fascinating... is with how all of this presumably supernatural peculiarity is handled and sometimes exploited by all involved, from the cults cashing in to the police finding it just another bloody hassle."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist still feels like a show in search of an urgent reason to exist, beyond the obligation to serve as one part of an intellectual property quintet that periodically intersects for team-up mini-series."
Dickinson,1,"'Dickinson' is a treasure chest of fun and brilliance, and its third season shines right at the top."
The Umbrella Academy,1,[Keeps] the Hargreeves' adventures feeling fresh with powerful new character developments and a fun set of villains to face off against.
Inventing Anna,1,"The modesty of its thematic and narrative ambitions keep Inventing Anna from being a great show. It could have been truly great if it had decided to really be about something, but instead it's content to just be fun."
Watchmen,1,There are few series that will challenge viewers in the way that Watchmen will. Watchmen feels like the first true successor to Game of Thrones and could easily eclipse Westworld as the network's best drama.
WandaVision,1,"I loved WandaVision, it's weird, funny, confusing, magical, and mysterious, taking advantage of its TV format to tell a story without hurry, dancing to the rhythm of its own drum. [Full review in Spanish]"
Little Fires Everywhere,0,Its proclivities towards suburban mom soap-opera-y melodrama in favor of something as thoughtful as its emotionally intelligent social topics are so undermining and blazingly frustrating at times.
The Act,0,"But what do we really learn about human nature, apart from: some people are weird? I enjoyed it for the performances: Chloë Sevigny, as Dee Dee's plain-talking neighbour Mel, and Joey King, who is brilliant as Dee Dee's helium-voiced daughter."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"As a viewer you're not sure whether to feel like you are intruding on conversations that perhaps you shouldn't be party to, or that you have by some magic become the fifth Beatle."
Roar,1,"Full of mystery and fantasy.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Watchmen,1,"The cast is owed a lot of credit for keeping the momentum going and the series grounded. King contains multitudes-as the de facto lead, she is capable of great compassion and anger in her quest for justice, which is complicated by her years on the force."
Foundation,1,The performances are staggering. Lee Pace is jaw-dropping as the Galactic Emperor Brother Day. Jared Harris portrays the role of Hari Seldon as if he's actually lived the character's life and Lou Llobell is unstoppable.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"Despite some undercooked relationship drama, the series promises strong female characters and a beautiful setting to spend some time within."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Plot-wise, G&G delivers. Good trash-plotting is like a river in full spate. A lot rushes past you, it all feels Very Dramatic (although, unlike a river, mostly because of the way it is scored) and you feel like the source will never run dry."
The Me You Can't See,1,"For all its clarity of vision and talk of a ""universal condition"", however, The Me You Can't See feels myopic on the burning issue that many, indeed most, people cannot afford years of therapy."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires everywhere's own tragic structure becomes like a tumor, victim of its own rules, and much of what could be left to subtext ends up revealing itself in the most explicit and forced fashion [ Full review in spanish]"
Reacher,1,"Alan Ritchson does not merely have the body type to play Reacher, he understands the character and makes the viewers like him."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Held up next to others of its kind, Wolf Like Me may not do enough to cement itself in memory, but it's an unexpectedly heartfelt tale..."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"An unmistakable urgency pushes The Man Who Fell to Earth — not just in Faraday’s mission and his belief in the ends justifying the means, but the environmental criticism guiding his journey and ours."
24,1,"Cool as it is to see Jack back in shoot-'em-up mode, the figure who caught my attention in the first two episodes was a new face: Yvonne Strahovski as disgraced CIA agent Kate Morgan."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Move over Zooey Deschanel, there's a new adorkable girl in town and her name is... well, we actually don't know her name just yet, but for the sake of avoiding confusion, we'll just call her the ""Mother""."
The Mist,1,"I'm intrigued. And there are only 10 episodes (unless there's a second season), so it might be worth the time investment."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"it's Alice who carries this tale, and it's good to see her again."
Mare of Easttown,1,"...a top-notch cop show, and an easy recommend for anyone who enjoys an old-school whodunit..."
Entourage,0,"The quality in Entourage's storytelling has been in steady decline, and last season even felt forced... I wish I could say it looks as though the eighth and final season is going to be better. I really can't."
What If...?,1,"Marvel's What If...? doesn't quite maximize the potential of the premise, but the first three episodes are packed full of exciting action, Easter Eggs and major surprises."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The original novel is quite a serious work and builds to an extraordinarily bleak and cynical ending. While one supposes this adaptation will head in the same direction, it seems intent on having a lot of fun on the way, which is perhaps just as well."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"As compelling as the real story may be, the early episodes of the series which were released to the press, are underwhelming..."
Review,1,"In showing us the sum of Forrest's travails, Review has given birth to something extraordinary: a bleak, serialized tragedy that inspires spasms of unrestrained laughter."
The Witcher,1,"If you loved Season 1, you'll love [The Witcher] Season 2, and if you've been skeptical about jumping into the Continent, now is time to take the leap."
Watchmen,1,"Sublime and absurd. It's a symphony in which the loudest note in every bar is proudly out of key. The plane it portrays, an alternative-history America in 2019, is at once disturbingly peculiar and unmistakably our own."
Stranger Things,1,"Four seasons in, I reckon it has never been better."
A Very English Scandal,1,Three hours is enough time for two great actors to craft performances whose collision-and an enmity that comes to look a bit like love-is some of the more edifying fun around.
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is a schlocky, high-budget thriller, an anxiety-laden romp, and the perfect vessel for the bulk of 2020's ambient, jittering neuroses."
For All Mankind,1,"[The premiere] still has time for a high-stakes Poseidon Adventure-style crisis that’s genuinely tense, emotional, and fully grounded in the things that have come before."
Alias,1,"Alias actually got better as it wound down in this season, and the show was allowed to give us a satisfactory wrap-up."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's not always an easy watch, but it is a rewarding one. Be afraid, be heartbroken, and be (somehow) uplifted by Mike Flanagan's most profound work to date."
The Boys,1,"Many may find that The Boys is retreading already well-worn territory. However, I think there is still plenty of life left in The Boys, and a depressingly endless amount of American hypocrisy and depravity to skewer."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Has its share of problems and a clear disdain for facts, but there’s enough reasons to be optimistic that the series can be a contender."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man improves so much over the course of its first six episodes that its potential feels limitless. If audiences can weather its apocalypse, the show might well become something special by the time rebuilding commences."
Succession,1,"Succession is not for the faint-hearted or easily offended, but doled out in a weekly dose, this may be just the deliciously dastardly dramatic escape you've been looking for."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Ms. Taylor-Joy is really the beginning and endgame of The Queen's Gambit, and gives a performance that is as precisely physical as it is emotional."
Justified,1,"Justified's love of the wacky short-story character ... has made it funnier and less self-serious than other superficially similar antihero shows, but it has also made it dunderheaded."
Twin Peaks,1,"I loved every plodding, baffling minute of it."
Waco,1,Waco wastes no time getting to the point. [Full Review in Spanish]
Succession,1,"The Roys gravitate towards each other not because of some familial bond, but because they've all been scarred by a shared past."
The First Lady,1,Their stories are compelling but it’s the cast and portrayals that draw you in and take hold.
A Very English Scandal,1,A Very English Scandal seemingly does the impossible: kicking a very dramatic narrative into goal but lining it with some uproarious moments and a lot of humour.
Peaky Blinders,1,"In Peaky Blinders, every scene -- every line -- is somehow vital... Peaky Blinders is its own world, to the degree that its frequent anachronisms hardly dent its sides."
Unbelievable,0,"As thematically fascinating as Unbelievable can be, it's also often dramatically plodding, if not grueling."
Breaking Bad,1,"I didn't mind the lack of jaw-dropping surprises, because that slow unraveling made such perfect emotional sense."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,HBO’s new sports drama is a lavish period piece unafraid to tell its story with painstakingly gradual detail.
And Just Like That...,1,Middle age has come with a certain grace.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"Season 11 is still working for our laughter, even as the music plays on."
Killing Eve,0,"However it plays out for Eve and Villanelle, the end can’t come soon enough."
The Staircase,1,"Where Making A Murderer dragged, The Staircase darts. Where Making A Murderer has you applauding your guesswork, The Staircase has you damned."
The Tourist,1,"This is a great little thriller, a show that constantly keeps you guessing and entertained in equal measure."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country won't be for everyone. It can be slow-moving and the nefarious cultists are generally a bland bunch... Still, there is lots of pulpy fun and some gory moments (the easily-spooked should avoid)."
Schmigadoon!,1,An enchanting and hilarious parody series
Altered Carbon,1,"Mackie gives Kovacs a suitable sort of intensity and loose-limbed physicality... New showrunner Alison Schapker (Lost, Fringe) continues expanding a fascinating world out of the novels by Richard K. Morgan."
Minx,1,"True to its title, Minx at its best is a sexy trifle, and the palpable chemistry between its leads counteracts the uptown girl/downtown boy cliché."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is a big budget, psychedelic soap opera, a high camp satire about the extreme wellness industry that is outrageous, engrossing and just a little bit silly in equal measure."
Servant,1,"Granted, the confounding nature of the Servant’s plot hasn’t affected my enjoyment of the series, which can be darkly funny, disturbing, bleak, and often incredibly tense, but I’d like to think I would have a better handle on the show by now."
Waco,1,Waco is an excellent addition to the subgenre.
Trying,1,"Season 2 is the same approach, but better."
Halo,0,"It’s exactly what you expect. While Halo features a few minor pivots in these early hours, there’s very little to spoil and even less to spark curiosity that’s not already present."
Russian Doll,1,"This time travel story is more traditional and a little less fun than last season’s perpetual weird night out, but it’s still a treat to spend time with one of modern television’s most interesting characters."
The Witcher,1,"Overall, the latest season of ""The Witcher"" is a dark fairy tale full of violence, gore (a lot of gore ... maybe too much?), and Destiny with a capital ""D."""
WeCrashed,1,"For all the talk of unicorns and rental leases and IPOs, the real drama is a human one."
Godless,1,"It's a great series: An old-fashioned Western revenge flick drawn out over seven splendid hours. The cinematography is gorgeous, it's well-plotted, and the actressin' is phenomenal all around"
BoJack Horseman,1,"I binged BoJack during a lossy time in my life. I watched to absorb a truism in digestible cartoon form: the more we flail around trying to avoid the pain of loss, the more we lose."
Minx,1,"Minx is effervescently fun, full of heart and smarts, and a heck of a lot of promise for what’s still to come. It’s a show that practices what it preaches, consistently prioritizing joy over pain and equality over repression."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"What feels so fresh—and so successful, thanks to stunning performances from Jackson and Fishback—is the boldness with which Mosley combines seemingly incompatible elements."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The fun, in fact, lies in the silliness - and in the degree to which Kidman telegraphs how badly things are about to go for everyone by balefully waggling her eyebrows."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,This series is a refreshing return to the original style of Star Trek through a 21st-century lens in a way J.J. Abrams’ reboot was unable to replicate. Trek purists will love this show and I hope new fans do as well.
Sharp Objects,1,Sharp Objects mixes murder and family into a gothic fable about the deep scars our cradles can leave behind.
Peacemaker,1,"Cena's comic timing and deadpan delivery raises the level of the entire series (well, so far), but Peacemaker is also compelling as a dramatic character with a past and with regrets."
The Wire,1,It's great to once again be in the company of these amazing actors... And it's a pleasure to be treated to amazing writing that doesn't try to simplify things and/or pander.
Foundation,1,Season one comes off as a 10-episode pilot for later seasons - one just good enough for us to want to stick with the show. But the sluggish storytelling suggests there were good reasons Asimov's books did not make it to screen before.
Raised by Wolves,1,Science fiction of this kind is sorely needed in a time of pure spectacle. It has a canvas that is rich to gaze at but it’s the intellectual stimulation that really delivers.
X-Men,1,"We've passed the threshold beyond which the animation for the show went sharply downhill... but the sheer novelty factor of it, the spectacle, makes it worth a watch."
Fargo,1,"By the end of this leisurely-paced opener, they had yet to cohere into something of substance."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Plays like an absurdly ambitious ""Saturday Night Live"" recurring sketch, or a much less ambitious musical spoof created expressly for the small screen."
Mare of Easttown,1,"With all the elements of a great mystery, led by a talented force, the series has everything needed to grip audiences and become our next tv obsession."
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace is a remarkable story.
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Netflix’s The Lincoln Lawyer will scratch the itch for anyone unexplainably hankering for a tedious, low-stakes legal drama."
Marvel's 616,1,"Dedicated Marvel fans probably won't mind the series' reluctance to turn a critical eye toward the company, and it's clear that everyone involved is a Marvel true believer."
A Teacher,1,"Television is a medium that allows us to live with characters; instead, A Teacher gives us a highlight reel of psychic convalescence, before ending on a note of oversimplified closure."
Bodyguard,1,"It's two things at once - the list of who did what and the reminder of what happened - and it feels nicely succinct. Like everything else about ""Bodyguard,"" including its hero, the opening is taut."
The Wire,1,"Some of the themes in The Wire may be generic (underpaid cops, newsroom politics), but the series achieves immense success in one vital regard for drama -- the feeling that we are in a real place."
Jericho,1,Jericho is more than an 800-pound metaphor. It works because it gets the little dramas right.
The Sopranos,1,Chase played us like a grand piano.
The Staircase,1,"Most of us would like to think that, if we were in Michael Peterson's position, certain processes would be in place."
11.22.63,1,"The premise of 11.22.63 is great and interesting, and while the material is too long for a feature film, it is too short for an 8-hour mini-series."
The Alienist,1,"Angel of Darkness bites off a lot more than The Alienist did the first time around, capitalizing on its team's established relationships to dig a little deeper into the issues of its time, and doesn't quite pull all of it off."
Parenthood,1,"The first hour of Parenthood's final season found the Braverman clan dealing with a number of thoroughly grown-up changes, all of them eliciting reactions ranging from, ""How could she?!"" to ""Can someone pass the Kleenex?"""
What If...?,1,Atwell's welcome return gives the alternative version of Peggy Carter both powerful confidence and engaging empathy.
Russian Doll,0,"The altered nature of Nadia and Alan’s predicament mostly just feels like, “Well, we got picked up for another season, so why not?”"
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob never really comes to life...
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia has its moments, but I'm not sure when dark became today's 'fresh and modern.' A little too dark for teens."
Little Voice,1,"O'Grady is a captivating presence and does a believable job of capturing Bess in her fragile moments and her stubborn ones, even when the scripts require her to make those shifts a bit too abruptly."
True Detective,1,"The first half of season 3 is promising, if a bit stiff, and anchored by Ali, who turns the Man Haunted by His Past into something a little different."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"The buildup works well, but many will question the unexpected ending. Regardless, the journey proves to be intriguing."
The Imagineering Story,1,"'The Imagineering Story' gives off that touch of magic that marks the house, marveling at its details. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Breaking Bad,1,"I could not be happier to see Breaking Bad return at the top of its game, tackling the beginning of the end with the same inventive, emotional spirit that defined the show during its greatest, most legendary periods."
Chernobyl,1,"""Chernobyl"" is a riveting drama that's full of payoffs."
Money Heist,0,"There comes a time in the life of a show where the story must end. The formula becomes predictable and the characters wear thin. Money Heist, or La Casa de Papel, has reached this unfortunate point."
Devs,0,It was one of those dramas where Everyone. Spoke. Very. Slowly. In. The. Hope. Of. Appearing. Deep. When. What. They. Really. Were. Was. Lethally. Boring.
Lovecraft Country,1,"There is no doubt Lovecraft Country is a thoroughly enjoyable, pulpy romp... There are flaws but the conviction and energy in Green's vision shines through."
Bel-Air,1,"In its 2022 iteration, Bel-Air capitalizes on the two things dominating television today: nitty-gritty realism, and nostalgia."
Little Voice,1,"There's little enough realism intruding on Little Voice, though, to make it something of an escapist treat, and a musical one."
Loki,1,The new Marvel series combines the inventiveness of WandaVision with the buddy-comedy repartee missing from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"The first two episodes of Season 2... feel more like pieces of the larger mega-franchise puzzle, and that's not its only problem right off the bat."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"It's one iconic actress acting against type, and another shading what she does best. For all the imperfections and missteps in adapting the source material, these lead performances are what light the match. It's the fire you tune in to see burn."
Review,1,"While it's bittersweet to see the show ending, it's beautiful to see it concluding on its own terms and doing it with such authoritative class."
You,1,"You is a sly guilty pleasure as such things go. Joe's prolific and wry inner dialogue narrates and critiques the action, ensuring that we see him as weird, funny, appealing, carnal, sexy and menacing."
Prison Break,1,"The show is as fast-moving as ever, with a trio that includes Sucre and C-Note all heading to super-dangerous Yemen to plan another big breakout as promised in the title."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Jones gives a big, charismatic performance, to match Anne’s big, charismatic personality, but she isn’t chewing up scenery or anything like that. She has many subtle -- and sublime -- small moments."
Gentleman Jack,1,... There's something infinitely comforting about being able to literally pick up right where we left off with the ongoing adventures of Anne Lister from creator Sally Wainwright.
Fleabag,1,"'Fleabag' comes to an end with an excellent second season that mixes humor, love, religion and bad milk. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Invincible,1,It's well written and the animation style is retro-cool.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I have to say, it's a downer of an introduction, and one that has dulled any anticipation for the next installment."
Fleabag,1,"All the show's vulgar charm - and there is plenty of that, and at its best you're fully conspiring with it - somehow runs down before its time."
Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets is a brutal coming-of-age story for adults who must reckon with the sins they committed to survive.
Friends,1,"Starting a TV show is hard. Ending one of the most beloved series of all time in a satisfactory manner? Almost impossible, yet Friends pulled it off here."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"The search for answers... make for a compelling first half of the season, resulting in the first truly bingeable season of a Marvel TV show since Daredevil season 1."
Stranger Things,1,"One of the better seasons of Stranger Things, offers more horror and higher stakes within its most ambitious story yet. [Full review in Spanish]"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers likely wouldn't impress at any point in the calendar. But the Hulu miniseries, adapted from a novel of the same name by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty, suffers from an especially serious case of bad timing."
Losing Alice,1,"Losing Alice, besides being a seductively-paced drama you may have trouble shutting off, is also a backdoor commentary on women who disappear from the entertainment business around middle age, both in front of the camera and behind it."
Midnight Mass,0,"The major revelations present no real crisis, and they should."
Inventing Anna,0,"The whole thing just does not work. It’s an over-stylised, overlong, over-acted and hilariously overblown soap opera."
Stranger Things,1,"It may have more characters than it knows what to do with, but Stranger Things’ most sinister season yet still knows how to send shivers up your spine."
The Wheel of Time,0,"[It] may bring in some fantasy fans starved for any morsel of magic and wonder. But the whole thing is empty, if expensive, calories."
Castle Rock,1,The show is finally more than a flailing attempt to monetize Stephen King-related intellectual property.
Peacemaker,1,"Self-conscious but never smug, sociopathic and yet also sweet, and timely if never preachy, it's the very sort of no-holds-barred, tongue-in-cheek endeavor that's become Gunn's specialty."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"All the additions made to Agent Carter season 2 benefit the series, but in the end the show's success is still rooted in Hayley Atwell's central performance, which only gains more texture as she spends more time with the character."
Halo,1,"A decent start that, despite its best efforts, failed to stun me. But it didn't drive me away, either."
The Witcher,1,"The writers understood what people liked and didn't like about the debut, because they give us more of the former, eliminating almost all of the latter. [Review in Spanish]"
The Adventures of Merlin,1,[There are] all things that make for an unsettling 43 minutes.
WeCrashed,1,"Within the bloat of its myriad acts of corporate intrigue, the push and pull of investors and board meetings, WeCrashed succeeds most when it keeps its focus on Hathaway’s space-cadet performance and the innate absurdity that underpins its true story."
Watchmen,1,"Presents its own kind of Rorschach test: Occasionally frustrating and meandering, it's never less than interesting, although that appeal might not extend much beyond acolytes of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' dark superhero tale."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Wolf Like Me is a delightful surprise. As as monster love story that resonates with genuine emotion and sharp psychology, it plays against type by being a drama first and foremost."
Ramy,1,"Ramy eventually veers towards episodes that highlight side characters which allows the series to have multiple perspectives on the Muslim-American immigrant experience. It's in these tangents, that the show shines."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Pay special notice to Mckenna Grace, who inhabits the young Theodora (or Theo) with a wisdom way beyond her years."
Bridgerton,1,Many of the main characters’ faces are now a little too familiar; some of the charm (and the sex) of the first installment are gone. But it’s still a comfy watch for the undemanding.
Alias,1,The contrast between this mundane dimension of Sydney's life and her athletic international intrigues was genuinely fun to see.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is especially compelling as many of us move toward some form of post-pandemic normalcy, raising questions about what new world awaits us after such tremendous, collective loss."
Lisey's Story,1,"It's perfectly crafted, austere and elliptically put together, but it does little to stir the blood."
A Wilderness of Error,1,"""A Wilderness of Error"" is a new kind of true documentary that will keep you on the edge of your seat and eager for more information."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"The brisk writing and pace keep it engaging, and it’s certainly more fun than getting called in for jury duty."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"The Boys Presents: Diabolical delivers a highly entertaining and visually distinct anthology with a variety of tones, stories, and animation styles."
The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the focus of future chapters will be tighter, but as far as the premiere episodes are concerned, youd be better off watching the documentary series first, before chasing it with Firths acting masterclass."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"Any new zombie-themed show must work hard to step out of The Walking Dead’s long shadow. Fortunately, All of Us Are Dead... pulls it off with a simple trick: It’s not so damn mean."
They Call Me Magic,1,"Call it nominative determinism, or simply a fair description, but the life and career of the man they named Magic Johnson has been nothing short of miraculous -- and this four-part docu-series proves it."
Sharp Objects,1,This one is not to be missed. Sharp Objects cuts deep.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The absence of villains, especially for an American show portraying Cold War era Russians, complements the dignity of the show."
The Wheel of Time,1,"While the premise is completely intriguing, the delivery doesn't always work for those new to this world. Still, there is much potential for the rest of the season."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Darkly funny (very), gory, despairing, riveting, tender and insightful."
Lovecraft Country,1,A ferociously compelling watch.
Schmigadoon!,1,"With high production values, sharp writing, and a nearly perfect cast, Schmigadoon! is off to a great start."
The Gilded Age,0,"The Gilded Age is lavishly made but dull. You can see the Fellowes formula from the opening minutes. It's Upstairs, Downstairs all over again."
Invincible,1,"While it might seem like the dark superhero trend is overdone, 'Invincible' is exciting, beautifully animated, and buoyed by a killer voice cast led by Steven Yeun."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Scenes such as Ed being allowed to explore his emotions are what make Our Flag Means Death so meaningful and, sadly, so rare in a landscape full of male-centered shows."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a fun new look at the MCU. For so long, we saw them stick their toes in the world of exploring genre, and this show feels like diving in head first, and I'm beyond excited to see where the show goes."
Sharp Objects,1,"Misogyny and trauma are the focus and the feeling of Sharp Objects, but the story is so empathetic to women's perspectives that it never feels exploitative. A deeply immersive, feminist take on TV crime."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,The year is 1925 and the times they are a-changin' - and creator Julian Fellowes really wants to make sure you know that.
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is doing a great job of expanding the magical world of this fictional universe.
Bodyguard,1,"The action is well mounted and the tension tightly wound; it uncoils, when it does, with a satisfying snap."
Moon Knight,1,This is an entertaining sliver of the MCU that plays like “Minority Report” meets “National Treasure” meets “Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde” meets “Split” meets “Venom.” (That’s a lot of meeting.)
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"It is clear that Ronson lives and breathes music, and some of the best moments are when he lets himself geek out to the fullest."
Sharp Objects,0,"It's slow, confusing, over-gothed and under-articulated. There's a good story squeaking from underneath all the messy baggage it carries, but it's probably easier to just go to Kmart for another suitcase rather than unpack this thing."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Without the weight of exposition, Iron Fist seems unbothered."
The Undoing,0,"Even if ""The Undoing"" finds its way around to acknowledging its rich, white protagonists are bad people - and they definitely are - it's already too late to turn the six-episode series into a scathing censure on privilege."
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks And Geeks works as well as it does because it's about fundamentally good people.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Always a standout in whatever she’s in, comedy and cabaret star Bridget Everett is the focus of the endearing new series Somebody Somewhere... Jeff Hiller is great as a high school friend who draws her out of her shell."
Chernobyl,1,"Unlike some historical miniseries, which take liberties with the truth, Chernobyl looks utterly legit."
Archive 81,1,"The series starts strong and keeps you invested throughout thanks to its eerie sound, otherworldly mysteries, unique structure, and cult conspiracies, even if it wraps a bit too tidily."
Loki,1,"Thanks to its retro-futuristic Mad Men meets Blade Runner vibe [...] and Natalie Holt's theremin-led background score that was wholly distinct from Marvel fare, Loki carved out an identity for itself."
Doom Patrol,1,"Season 3 continues this trend, with hilariously weird moments seamlessly giving way to internalized therapy sessions you can't find anywhere else in the genre."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,The Gemstones have lost none of their luster.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"Alice's battles with various computer-animated and live-action threats are entertaining and, usually, rather witty, though her traveling companions, the White Rabbit and the Knave of Hearts, get most of the best lines."
11.22.63,1,"This ambitious adaptation of Stephen King's novel sets out to achieve a lot in just eight episodes. And in the end it does, thanks to solid acting and some incredibly convenient plot points."
Loki,1,[Loki] dares to expand the walls of the MCU beyond what's known to give us a closer look at its cosmic underpinnings.
Lisey's Story,0,There's a whimsy that Stephen King usually has that is absent in total.
True Detective,0,"The third season of True Detective plays to the first season's strengths, but it also feels like an admission of defeat."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen encapsulates the weariness of Black America, our wounds healing just enough for the scabs to be torn off again."
Loot,1,Loot is most often a pleasantly frictionless workplace comedy. But the moments in which it’s not are the show’s most compelling by a long shot.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Season 2 of Luke Cage makes the show more of an ensemble project, and it's exactly what it needed to continue capturing fan attention."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is the show. Her performance is fascinating - powerful, but she never overpowers it. It's a difficult task to make someone want to watch you suffer."
Trying,1,"A delightfully funny, wry and honest look at a London couple trying to have a baby."
Hawkeye,1,"A chill is in the air, snow might fall, and crunchy action is likely to break out at any time without a moment's notice in Hawkeye."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"It seems silly to think that a Disney Channel show about an average, adolescent girl could have been powerful enough to leave you with a memory that you carry 12 years after the show... However, I do."
Six Feet Under,1,It's the only show I can think of that makes tragedy positively delicious and delectable.
The Boys,1,"From the get-go, it’s clear that <I>The Boys</I> season 3 isn’t content to rest on its laurels and bask in the glow of its well-received second outing. The rubber meets the road quickly and loudly."
Outer Range,1,This well-written quirky series from showrunner Brian Watkins will have you hooked from the start.
The Wire,1,"Ultimately, the show doesn't even have a moustache-twirling villain. There are just people. David Simon and his brilliant cast and crew did everything in their power to depict these people are honestly and fairly as possible."
Shadow and Bone,1,"There's plenty to like about Shadow and Bone, not least its 19th century Russia-inspired aesthetic, and at eight episodes, it doesn't overstay its welcome."
Little Voice,1,"Like the music that weaves its way throughout the series, Little Voice is authentic, warm and captivating."
Squid Game,1,"For the most part, writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk's mix of high and low elements like that works incredibly well."
Normal People,1,"Powerfully demonstrates the maxim of 'show, don't tell': it translates an intensely interior story to a visual medium using mood and tone..."
And Just Like That...,0,"Lacking sharp characterisation, believability and bite, this is a too-often cringey attempt to drag the women of Sex And The City into 2021."
Mindhunter,1,Excellent performances. [Full review in Spanish]
Only Murders in the Building,1,"A gentle comedy and a thoroughly entertaining mystery, Only Murders in the Building season two is so good that I kind of hope people keep getting knocked off in that old apartment forever."
The Staircase,1,"It speaks well for the show that even after having watched this story for 13 unscripted hours, I still have plenty left I want to see here."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a bit more entertaining than browsing the relevant Wiki articles, but it's a hell of a lot longer and ultimately less satisfying because, unlike that gathering of information, it sacrifices clarity for drama."
The White Lotus,1,"""The White Lotus"" sneaks essential questions in between the laughs. It is certainly among the year's best TV offerings."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The show's insistence on progressing towards that bonkers twist, however, results in it sacrificing storytelling in favour of shock. Not only is it frustrating on its own, it's detrimental to the writing..."
A Very English Scandal,1,"This masterful drama certainly resurrects the seedier, more headline-grabbing elements of the case and retells them with stunning panache and beautiful comic timing - but the effect now is... to put that version of England on trial."
Chuck,1,"Chuck might not go down in history as the most masterful TV series of all time, but dangit, it had more heart than 99 percent of the shows out there."
Sharp Objects,1,"Self-harm looms large in twisty, dark book-based series."
Welcome to Earth,1,"Enter Welcome to Earth, which allows Smith to explore the world with those who do so professionally, in what amounts to a cheerful exercise in nature programming for beginners."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"For a series set almost 100 years ago, the storylines were surprisingly relevant today."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Full of enjoyable action, mostly enjoyable characters and a simple plot that's great to see unfold."
Two and a Half Men,0,"So really, was Two and a Half Men just a regular sitcom, or was it the greatest episode of Black Mirror ever about a bunch of actors stuck forever inside a sitcom of hell."
Glee,1,It was a well-earned love letter. But it was also a reminder of the potential that the series once had and that it only intermittently lived up to.
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe...is more than a sitcom. It is the reinvention of the narrative of parenthood. No, I don't think that is grandiose."
Vigil,1,Vigil has everything it needs.
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's an astonishingly nihilistic series, gorgeously made, and for all its macabre humour, very moving."
Irma Vep,1,"It’s certainly a slow burn when it comes to plot, but if you love peeking into the world of making movies and TV, and atypical storytelling, Irma Vep is one to watch."
Twin Peaks,1,David Lynch's cult-classic revival is exactly as imaginative-and as uncomfortable-as it always needed to be.
Bodyguard,1,"More concerned with being a good ride than exploring character or politics, the show is awash in a timely cynicism."
Pachinko,1,"Nostalgic and reminiscent, a new Korean, Japanese and English family drama details a painful history between two nations and its effect on a multigenerational family."
Mad Men,1,"The show has never been about wrapping up a plot, catching a criminal, or solving a riddle. It's simply about taking a certain group of characters over a set span of time-the 1960s-and showing us who they are at the beginning and the end of it."
Twin Peaks,1,More intellectually and emotionally stimulating than anything I've seen in a long time.
Dickinson,1,Dickinson reaches brilliant and mature heights in its exploration of a unique voice. [Full review in Spanish]
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase demonstrates how to ride the wave of a sensational true story, zooming in on fine details before pulling back to unleash game-changing revelations at the steady rate of one stunner per episode."
The Night Of,1,"If I had to cite one reason to keep tuning in, it's John Turturro."
Hellbound,1,"At a time when many shows struggle to keep you engaged to the end of a pilot, piling on contrivances and reveals to force a sense of momentum, Yeon and Choi begin with a bang... and then immediately ground the drama."
Jersey Shore,1,"This final season of Jersey Shore is weirdly thrilling: In a culture that has become addicted to train-wrecks, Jersey Shore has become a show about survivors trying to put themselves back together."
Pachinko,1,"Historical epics aren’t new. Nor are family dramas that span generations, or period pieces... And yet, Apple TV Plus’ newest drama, Pachinko, manages to take all of these tropes and refine them into something beautifully specific and new."
Big Little Lies,1,"Big Little Lies started out with an embarrassment of riches, and season two offers more of the same, generously giving fans everything they could want and then some."
His Dark Materials,0,"For avid Pullman fans, the series might be a treat. The problem for the rest of us is that it lacks both the novelty of series one and the exciting narrative - it now feels very dense, which works well in a novel but less so in a TV series."
Dickinson,1,"It's doubtful Dickinson Season 3 will convert any new subscribers to AppleTV+. Still, the final season provides a strong salute to wartime poet Emily Dickinson."
Black Summer,1,Black Summer has encapsulated the intricacies of human flaws.
Foundation,1,"Foundation isn't sure if it wants to be a philosophic metaphor for war and why we should listen to the thinkers not the shooters, or if it wants to be a sexed-up sci-fi about revolutionaries carrying on a movement long after the founder has gone."
Fargo,1,"Is it bad? Not exactly. But it is kind of dull, and what's striking is how tentatively the new season seems to be willing to engage in those few elements of its setting that are unique."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"It’s not quite as piercing as Apatow’s Shandling doc, but it’s still a pretty thorough and engaging look at who Carlin was and how he frustratingly refused to fit into the box you’d want him to fit in."
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good is a beautiful achievement, kind, human, as clever as it is funny."
Normal People,1,"Hulu's Normal People is a vivid and intimate look at young, messy love, anchored by two powerfully vulnerable performances."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Valhalla is promising, offering an exciting new batch of characters, but it needs to fix its pacing issue and lean into more of its strengths rather than trying to retread the path of history."
Barry,1,"Still strange, dark, harrowing and often — unexpectedly — very funny."
Ozark,1,"If it all sounds kind of ridiculous it's because it is. But it's also massively entertaining, largely because of the performances."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Despite some clunky writing, I am curious to see how each character's story unfolds, which gives me hope for a potential season two. I can envision a second season where the show musters up a little more authenticity."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The show is steeped in the classic hard-boiled world of good old-fashioned policing. But it is the characters we care about, even though they appear deficient when displaying emotion."
Stranger Things,1,I can't wait to be surprised by this inventive and bold series yet again.
Big Little Lies,0,"It's simple enough to write off Season 2 as a novel if unsuccessful experiment -- one that was watchable enough and delivered strong moments, without making a convincing case for its own existence."
Stranger Things,1,"Some storylines are stronger than others, but it's still an utter thrill and joy to be reunited with these characters. Of the bunch, the situation unfolding in Hawkins is the standout with some especially impressive work from Sadie Sink as Max."
WandaVision,1,"I'm digging ""The Truman Show"" style of it all, but the jury is still out if the gamble will ultimately pay off or become tiresome."
House of Cards,1,"Claire as the lead offers a different perspective, a worthy way to end a series that launched hundreds of other shows."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"The mad, chaotic energy of Behind Her Eyes feels almost like a practical joke, the kind of prank you'd expect to end with an epilogue featuring a drunk Ashton Kutcher explaining that this, in fact, a simulation."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit is a handsome limited series about a particularly ugly American sensibility. Its warning may be old news, but its means of communicating its point proves compelling."
Mr. Robot,1,"To be a successful final season, Mr. Robot not only needs to make us believe that Elliot is capable of pulling off the impossible, but that he cares with a deep burning sense of burden and responsibility. Mission accomplished so far."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"The uniquely identifiable characters come to life thanks to wonderful casting choices and compelling, yet familiar, dialogue."
Legion,1,"If you've jumped off the ride at some point over the past two years, do yourself a favour and hop back on the merry-go-round for this final season of Legion."
The Expanse,1,"The Expanse's final season is short on episodes and on character development, which is a shame."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It would work to the show's advantage to lean on its Broadway cast more and not be afraid to find the humor in darker topics. Either way, I'm off to sing ""Corn Pudding"" one more time!"
11.22.63,1,"It's a fun and easily absorbing thriller wrapped inside a cautionary tale about indulging in nostalgia - and best of all, it has a definite and emotionally satisfying conclusion."
Barry,1,"Among the many gifts Bill Hader delivers in this fabulous new chapter of his series is that, in picking off almost exactly where he left us, it feels almost as if the last two years never happened. How great is that?"
Behind Her Eyes,1,"A fantastically entertaining magic trick of a TV show, so confident in its incongruous genre mashup that you won't be able to look away."
Cowboy Bebop,1,Cowboy Bebop's atmospheric animation is a notch above the static images of many anime.
The Undoing,1,A curiously one-note affair with nonetheless impeccable performances.
Save Me,1,"Learning lessons and wisely evolving from its stylistic first series, Save Me Too is a successful sequel to what was already an obsessive mystery."
The Alienist,1,"The Alienist returns with the same handsome-looking production and entertaining fusion of history and fictional embellishment, and with Dakota Fanning's Sara Howard occupying the limelight there's plenty of potential in this new season."
WandaVision,1,"The respect for old sitcoms is seen in the loving reimagining of classic sets, giving the superheroes a lot of space to send plates flying through the air, or to find live storks wandering around the living room."
The Stand,1,Certainly an improvement over the original mini-series from a technical standpoint even if it doesn't quite come together as well as it could have.
Schmigadoon!,1,"If you're a person who, say, wrote a substantial paper about movie musicals in college (ahem), it's a lot of fun picking over choreography flourishes and musical and lyrical flourishes as they are, in some cases, mashed up with modern life."
Entourage,0,"Look, you've had your fun, Entourage. Those viewers who thought the party got old? They don't need to hug it out."
The Night Of,1,"There's a good chance by the time September gets here, you'll be referring to ""the night of"" your massive The Night Of binge session."
Bodyguard,1,Madden's face is the kind of canvas that you want to watch for clues.
The Witcher,1,It's great fun provided you're willing to buy into the Playstation 4 quality of the whole thing.
Good Sam,1,"Bush and Isaacs prove well-matched for the task of portraying this particularly thorny, complex relationship."
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob is not bad so much as the result of what happens when you try to reverse-engineer a bestseller into a conversation-starter, and prestige-TV it to death."
Mr. Corman,1,"Arturo Castro has been underrated hilarious in every show he does, but he does yeoman's work here as Victor."
The Outsider,1,"The story is a slog, though, and I think it's the biggest hurdle viewers will face. Assuming it ends well, I feel like The Outsider would work better as a binge watch."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"[It] is lots of fun in places and compelling throughout, but is conscious of just how fraught its storylines are."
The Good Place,1,"The jokes are solid and come in predictable beats, thanks to a writers room staffed by some of the funniest people in Hollywood."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"This back-to-basics prequel embodies a lot of the best of the original Star Trek with its charming ensemble and episodic structure - but it also managed to dredge up some 1960s morality, too, with its questionable depiction of disability"
Midnight Mass,0,"The ensemble cast does some great work with the material given, and Linklater gives one of the best performances of his career. But it lacks the enveloping nature of Flanagan's previous horrors."
Ozark,1,"Ozark continues to take its audience on a suspenseful ride, delivering its most thrilling season yet."
1883,1,"Despite a clunky voiceover, ""1883"" feels like another durable, dependable show about broncos, cattlemen, and drovers trying to find their slice of the American dream and make their way in the world."
Under the Dome,1,The most relatable aspects of Under the Dome focus on the question of sustainability.
The Act,1,"The Act is a gothic horror Lifetime movie on steroids, and I say that only with love. Great lead performances anchor it, but the series might have benefited from fewer episodes"
Unbelievable,1,"It's a powerful, impactful show that will stay with you for a long time. An unflinching look at justice, inequality, and the fantasy of a perfect victim."
Looking for Alaska,1,"In Schwartz and Savage's hands, Looking for Alaska actually manages to improve upon the original work-no small feat for an onscreen adaptation of a beloved book."
Mr. Corman,1,"Gordon-Levitt throws everything into the early episodes. The first has too many didactic exchanges, but the ideas start to impress, even if they don't always illuminate each other."
The Stand,0,"Despite a talented, A-list cast, plenty of time to develop the complex story, a seemingly hefty budget and one of King's most celebrated works as inspiration, the new ""Stand"" adaptation falls mostly flat."
Veep,1,"Everyone is either a fool, a knave or a monster in HBO's hilariously scabrous political satire starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus. After seven seasons, Veep ends its run with its sharp teeth fully intact."
Watchmen,1,"Like a perfectly crafted watch, Watchmen is a masterclass around story structure. It becomes nearly perfect at its mid-point, only to break our own minds in its revolving connectivity to real history. Simply incredible. [Full review in Spanish]"
Hawkeye,0,"The show has so little faith in our interest in Clint Barton as a character that it buries his best moments under a sea of Kate Bishop screentime and backstory, hoping the shiny new hero will appease audiences more than Renner's veteran."
The Fall,1,"This is The Fall, which doesn't squander opportunities to show off its mastery of the slow burn."
Twin Peaks,1,"It is deliberately, punishingly tedious -- but that's why Twin Peaks is so beguiling."
Love,1,"Season 3 does manage to end on something of a transcendent moment while remaining as semi-sweet as what's come before, and we'll always remember the show with fondness."
Lisey's Story,1,"The Lisey's Story series allows viewers to see Stephen King's mind unleashed...for better or worse. The ride is enjoyable, though, filled with memorable moments"
The Leftovers,1,But this miraculous series masterfully holds ambiguity and extremely robust storytelling in the same generous bear hug.
Mare of Easttown,1,"As Mare, Kate Winslet crackles in a role we haven't seen from her in her decades long career."
Westworld,1,"Say what you will about Westworld, the show is unafraid to take risks and swing for the fences, and the rare moments it fully succeeds are more than enough to get me to plug back in."
Midnight Mass,0,"For me, Midnight Mass's conclusion feels less like a soothing balm in a moment of crisis, and more like an outright lie."
30 Rock,1,"On a purely joke-for-joke basis the seven seasons of Tina Fey's TV industry satire might be the best US sitcom of all time. Based on Fey's own experiences as a Saturday Night Live head writer, this was democratic ensemble farce of the highest calibre."
Rise,1,"... takes some of ""Glee's"" exuberance and mixes it with a ""This Is Us""-style feel."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Funnier and more involved because we're dealing with established characters and because the writers, led by showrunner John Hoffman, have a firmer grasp on the show's tone and a more confident hand in its plotting."
The Gilded Age,0,"The sets are grand, the costumes are marvelous and every word out of Christine Baranskis mouth drips with venom. So why do the minutes pass by so slowly?"
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"The show's real power resides in Lowe herself, whose screen presence makes even the silliest bits of Wonderland work better than they probably deserve to."
Foundation,1,"The opening two episodes of Foundation are extremely promising, covering a lot of ground and leaving you desperate to see where the story will go, as well as delivering some earthshaking shock moments."
Money Heist,1,"However, it's a good formula, there are always twists and you never know which character is going to die."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,One of the show's greatest strengths is the way it delicately balances drama and comedy throughout.
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Much like our hero, it's clear that the series still has its share of growing pains to work through, but Season 2 at least marks a step in the right direction."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Yes there were missteps, but this will be remembered as a show delivering compelling, emotional moments in nearly every episode, along with some of the most layered and thought-provoking situations and characters you'd find on television."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Marvel could use more shows like ""Jessica Jones"" as it relaunches on streaming via Disney+ and Hulu. But next time, it should worry less about seeming serious, or cool, and focus more on telling the best stories in the best way possible."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Grant and Whishaw play their parts heartbreakingly well, especially Grant, who manages to make Thorpe both tragic and loathsome."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"After anxious months of geeky Web speculation over how Battlestar's final season will conclude, the best thing about ""He That Believeth in Me"" was how it bypassed our feverish expectations and instead set up new central conflicts."
Love Life,1,Harper's on-screen charisma and that of his co-stars is ultimately what keeps this season afloat.
Foundation,1,"The result is an adaptation that's generally faithful to Asimov's original work, but that also expands on events in interesting ways that the exposition-heavy novel didn't in 1951."
The Great,1,"In Season 2, The Great is as delightful as its characters are dysfunctional. Long may it reign."
RENO 911!,1,"Perfectly accessible for new audiences and just as hilarious as ever for fans of the original series and spinoff film, Reno 911! has found a perfect format in Quibi."
Yellowjackets,1,"While 'Yellowjackets' features strong performances from its leads and poses intriguing questions about human nature pushed to extremes, ultimately it feels crowded with too many plot points and characters."
The Sopranos,1,"[Creator David] Chase was true to himself, and that's what made The Sopranos brilliant on Sunday night, and the 85 episodes that went before."
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman has the potential to become something truly great and powerful, a modern-day mirror to the glorifying of perceived trauma that has come to define so many narratives. You just have to give it space to get there."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Episodes are paced at a glacial level, and strong performances nonetheless lose themselves in the grim soup of the show's overall tone. There's a creeping feeling that we've seen so much of this before."
Chappelle's Show,1,Part of [Dave] Chappelle's charm is that he makes all this dangerous material look effortless.
RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars,0,The show has gone too far in its pursuit of turning queer art into a commodity. What business does the cast of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” Season 7 have at a stock exchange?
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The show has taken on a new tone, a slightly altered title sequence, and improved fight sequence editing, which is great. However, it's immediately apparent how much is impossible to change."
A Teacher,1,"Maybe A Teacher will stir awareness of the insidious patterns of abuse, but its storytelling doesn't rise to the complexity of its subject matter."
Silicon Valley,0,"[F]or a show and creator known for supreme social commentary, they both certainly have their blind spots."
Death Note,1,"The storyline is terrific -- as with horror-fantasies like Boogiepop Phantom and Paranoia Agent, Death Note doesn't limit the focus to the protagonist, and it considers the effects his activities would have on society at large."
Halo,1,"As much as the premiere focuses on capturing the iconic weapons and technology from the games, it also shows a willingness to move its story in dramatically different directions."
Mad Men,0,"The start to the bifurcated final season feels more indifferently paced than most - and thanks to the gradual push further into the 1960s, perhaps too groovy and scattered for its own good."
Archive 81,1,Analog horrors haunt Netflix's uneven new supernatural series.
Peacemaker,1,The most interesting part of such a basic and elementary series... is its constant and contradictory dialogue with political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]
Little America,1,"The key is in the chosen tone, without being showy or excessively sentimental. There's no big declarations other than the entrance to those private worlds, always seen with the eyes of those who arrive to stay. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"At once veering away any prior adaptation of Jackson's novel and paying tribute to staples of the horror genre, Hill House is an addictive slow burn of a binge that will have you biting your blanket in fear and tiptoeing in the dark."
Players,1,"Players is a decent way to get a sense for the League of Legends community. But, in its attempt to skewer the scene with awkward humor, it becomes an awkward hybrid itself, one that never leans fully enough into either drama or jokes."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Smollett is especially good at taking a heroic stance. She is the character you most don't want to mess with, though it's Wunmi Mosaku, as her economically frustrated sister Ruby, who makes the greater impression, in a transmogrification storyline."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass delivers creeping dread while exploring themes of faith, fanaticism and redemption. It's heady, highbrow horror that, though talky, grows more engrossing the longer you stick with it."
Homeland,1,"Taking plenty of dramatic license, Homeland has always put a spotlight on how the decisions, the feints and the gut calls made by nameless operatives in the field can avert disaster and change the course of history."
The Right Stuff,1,"This is Nat Geo's first original scripted series for Disney+ and it's a successful launch, pardon the pun..."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Scenes from a Marriage is a whole mess of gray, and if that's what we all feel after watching it, then perhaps it did its job."
The Boondocks,0,"The new season is a copy of McGruder's baby made from a printer that needs a fresh ink cartridge. The clear, hard lines of McGruder's vision and sensibility aren't the only things that are a little faded."
Alias,1,"As a big fan of Sydney, Jack and the gang, I thought they went out the right way and have to give praise one last time."
The White Lotus,1,"The strong cast includes Connie Britton, Steve Zahn and a never-better Jennifer Coolidge, giving us a character who's a fascinating mix of pampered idiot, pitiful overgrown child and insatiably needy monster."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The Beatles: Get Back is, in the end, the consummate hangout movie."
Twin Peaks,1,"[David lynch] has burst out of the glass box of kitschy remembrance. . .giving us the brilliant, the slick, the sick; the weird, of course, but the deeply human that made Twin Peaks so special all those years ago."
Landscapers,1,"Director Will Sharpe shows sets being decommissioned, while the characters lie to themselves so they can continue to believe what they need to. Tragedy has almost a tenderness in these scenes."
The Night Of,1,A captivating series that will have you hooked within minutes.
Everybody Hates Chris,1,"[The] season finale of CW's Everybody Hates Chris, which ended with a fabulous nod to the finale of The Sopranos, did everything you could ask of a clever comedy."
Halo,1,"The world-building is impressive, and Pablo Schreiber is an excellent choice for Master Chief. A few ideas do not translate as well as they intend, but the potential is there."
24,1,"In this universe, that so resembles yours, there's no option for being cast out, for remaining out, that choices cannot be made, but are only made for [Chloe] and Jack Bauer and you, too."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Each character, each story, each line serves a purpose that helps to build a world of mystery, magic and Lovecraftian lore."
Bridgerton,1,"The sophomore outing of Bridgerton is just as delightful as its first, even if it’s much safer. The Shondaland-produced series is still an effortlessly binge-able, dreamy fantasy of a diverse and passionate Regency-era London."
Money Heist,1,"The characters engage with the soul. It feels like comfort food. Your heart paces, but you feel at home."
Game of Thrones,0,Daenerys and Cersei are portrayed as too ambitious and emotionally unfit to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
The Night Of,1,"Drawing influences from The Wire, this HBO show boldly tackles race in the face of the criminal justice system."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Just because ""Problem"" resembles much of what other comedians including Oliver, Seth Meyers and Samantha Bee are doing in the late-night talk show space doesn't mean that it has nothing to add to the conversation."
Good Sam,0,Good Sam offers both medical-case-of-the-week and soapy storylines along with the who-needs-who more back-and-forth between father and daughter. This one's more middling OK than good.
Review,1,"No reasonable person would subject himself to this job. So Review, disturbingly and effectively, asks: What kind of unreasonable person would do it?"
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"The best thing ""Game Changers"" offers is how it unabashedly embraces the world it exists within, representing a seamless continuation of the movies even as it carries the ball - sorry, puck - forward for a new generation."
Minx,1,Minx is a fun examination of not only evolving sexual politics but the myriad emotions behind them.
Little America,1,"Little America is a thoughtful show, made with evident care and consideration for doing justice to the heritages depicted."
Rome,1,Over two seasons... Rome is an intricately plotted story about political power and intimate human dilemmas and crises. It makes Game of Thrones look like a game for children.
The Essex Serpent,1,Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes effectively anchor The Essex Serpent with playful and passionate chemistry that crackles even when the overly ambitious limited series loses its way at times.
Foundation,1,"Austere and slow-moving, Foundation may not boast characters that immediately grab you. But this stylish, serious series lays a solid foundation for an intriguing sci-fi diversion."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"With series finales, TV shows are asked to do something they have never done before: properly end the story. The results are often, -forgive the pun - middling. The Vampire Diaries managed to beat the odds by following a few simple rules."
Dark,1,"The headache inducing series has come to an end, with a confusing and lukewarm finale. But somehow, it worked. [Full review in Spanish]."
Hacks,1,Hacks remains in top form as comic Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) and her young writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder) hit the road as the secret of Ava's betrayal simmers in the background.
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested was always a zany version of reality, but the cartoonishness feels hyperbolic now, unfocused."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"With such a limited running time, these stories pack a lot in. They hit the spot more often than not and will satiate your bloodlust while waiting for the main event."
Counterpart,1,"""Counterpart"" is finely woven to the point where missing key beats can throw the whole thing off for you. It's a riveting mind game, expertly pulled off."
The Flight Attendant,1,"What this season excels at is Cuoco’s character work as Cassie -- not only as all the alternate versions of her in the mind palace, but also as the real-world version of her, who’s working through her trauma, addiction, and self-sabotaging tendencies."
Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets is a twisted treat for people who seek out the dark side of streaming. It's completely original and thoroughly deranged in all the right ways.
The Flight Attendant,1,"Kaley Cuoco Shines In An Enticing, But Uneven Attempt To Recapture Previous Heights."
Mythic Quest,1,"With some true gems over the course of Season 2, there's plenty of reason to put Mythic Quest in your weekly rotation."
The Leftovers,0,It should feel like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? It actually feels like The Real Housewives of New Jersey.
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is bleak by design. It offers little relief. It is sweaty and slow, with the sensory inputs - like all that sound - turned up until the walls and weather close in."
The Offer,0,"It suffers, like so much in the streaming world, from repetition and extreme overlength..."
Younger,1,"As fun as it has been to see the show highlight the rise of millennials, it's even more fun to watch them all struggle to deal with the fact they are getting older."
Inventing Anna,0,"What’s the point? In the case of Inventing Anna, the answer is some ethically muddled, bizarrely patronizing mumbo-jumbo about how women are punished for doing things that men get away with. Okay? Is that all?"
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's the pain, the loneliness, the desperation that grips their strained faces, pools in their eyes, and reaches across the screen to make you turn back on the lights. Now that, that feels real."
What If...?,1,The third one was [my favorite] but... they get they get significantly better as they go along.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Viewers who can suspend their disbelief about that setup may be able to enjoy this conspiracy thriller that feels, frustratingly, like a wild goose chase."
The Good Wife,1,"I thoroughly enjoyed the season premiere, in part because I was able to check my expectations."
The Wire,1,"Even if you came to series five cold, from a Wireless world, you'd have found plenty to enjoy: the way the dialogue is at once naturalistic and aphor-istic [and] the outstanding naturalism of the performances."
Loki,1,"The blessing of Loki is that there's no reason to believe Mobius is actually right. He may not even believe what he's saying. As a way to manipulate a master manipulator, telling Loki he's incapable of change or success is a brilliant stroke."
Heartstopper,1,"Its feel-good, without being contrived, or ignoring any of the challenges of coming of age as an LGBTQ teen."
Dickinson,1,"Sharp and irreverent, weird and sexy, and just anachronistic enough to have something to say without getting tiresome, Dickinson has been wholly and idiosyncratically itself since the day it premiered."
WandaVision,1,Some inspired moments start to lose their effectiveness because there's less story than there is time to fill. But a new regime brings with it a greater chance that the payoff will justify the patience.
Harlots,1,"Harlots never pretends that its characters' lives are easy -- they're still at the mercy of a legal system that wasn't designed for them. It just shows that people like them existed, which is all they need to do to be worthy of portrayal."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"This is a fly on the wall documentary about a family, with the intimacy so intense at times you almost feel like you should look away or stop eavesdropping. Almost."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Though the series has its missteps, lacking the novel's gentle nuance and oscillating in tone between ""soap opera"" and ""intro to women's studies course,"" it sometimes succeeds at this mission..."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon! is funny, quirky, and had me saying, ""I'm just so happy for Cecily Strong,"" out loud multiple times."
The Orville,1,A level-up in terms of craft and story as Seth MacFarlane’s space series settles into its new home at Hulu.
The Legend of Korra,1,"I loved this show by the end, and I can't tell you how happy it made me to see such a strong lineup of female characters, led by the strongest who was a woman of color."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a trip! Unique and refreshing, it's top tier MCU series. Oscar Isaac is fantastic, and the darkhorror tone, humor and action, are all brilliant. Full review in Spanish"
You,1,"While it is always good fun to see Badgely deliver Joe's narcissism and delusional but witty outlook on romance, it has to be said that Pedretti really is the most valuable and interesting figure in the third run."
The Stand,0,This adaptation of The Stand is content to scratch the surface of these individuals. It's an oddly revealing failure of nerve.
Vigil,1,The rhythm is impeccable up until the third episode... but everything works. [Full review in Spanish]
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,A proper ending for a unique and memorable ensemble drama that has had a few ups and downs over the years.
House of Cards,1,The king is dead; long live the queen. That is the mantra for the sixth and final season of Netflix's House Of Cards.
The Undoing,1,"Go for the high-wattage cast, gorgeous outfits and stunning homes; stay for the secrets, twists and shocks. The Undoing is perfect entertainment for a cold-weather, stay-at-home time."
Gravity Falls,1,"It's funny, emotional, beautiful, and terrifying in equal measure."
The White Lotus,1,"White Lotus is wholly entertaining, but its waters aren't as deep as they could have been."
Superstore,0,"Looking at the way the masked actors try valiantly to make the comedy go over with only their eyes and brows in the front-of-house scenes, I can see why the show made this decision, but still: Two raps on the knuckles from Dr. Fauci for that one."
Ozark,1,"Watching ""Ozark"" with the mindset of watching a soap opera opens the whole thing up. Oh the joy."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Luke Cage season two is a solid watch that suffers from the same problems as all the Marvel Netflix shows do.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Each of the attendees are cliches of various stripes, nonetheless played by big names."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,It's difficult to turn away from due to just how incredibly nuanced the performances of [Reese] Witherspoon and [Kerry] Washington are.
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"These human-interest stories are undeniably powerful at times, and the series is reasonably well-made."
Slow Horses,1,"It’s a decent start to the series. In addition to getting a sense of the MI5 pecking order, we also learn a bit about all the people working at Slough House."
Turner & Hooch,1,"There's a good bit of action and a lot of humor, both involving Hooch and the various people in Scott's life. However, there's a lot of room for improvement."
Peaky Blinders,1,It’s clever – both predictable and yet exciting at the same time.
The Gilded Age,0,"There's an aimlessness to The Gilded Age: Somewhere along the line, someone forgot to ask why a show about these particular characters at this particular time would be compelling."
Mayans M.C.,1,"The storytelling was on top form, and the writers did a great job of cleverly executing this revelation that has officially lit the fuse on the war between the Mayans and the Sons of Anarchy."
Swagger,1,"Even when it seems obvious what will come out of Swagger's playbook next, the way it gets drawn up is often surprisingly satisfying."
The Thing About Pam,0,"It’d be a shame if Zellweger’s first acting gig after her Oscar-boosted return to Hollywood were, ultimately, little more than NBC cross-promotion."
Key & Peele,1,Key & Peele's fifth season premiere is a bit like getting a terrific high five from your coolest friend at a party that's so cool you can't even believe you were invited.
Watchmen,1,"...by the time Jean Smart enters in episode three, you know I was on board, full-stop."
The Mist,1,"A solid reimagining of the Stephen King novella of the same name, The Mist is an intriguing new example of scary TV."
This Is Us,1,"There’s nothing wrong with This Is Us as a respite from all of this mayhem. This week’s Thanksgiving episode is one of the best. And no fires to put out, except for the emotional ones."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Vasan does a brilliant job of letting the character's quirky innocence evolve as she discovers the power of punk within herself, while Impey finds both the sharp edges and vulnerable sides of Saira."
The Office,1,"So this is it, the end. The Office is finally over, and while it still stings, I'm left satisfied and happy with no lingering questions or doubts"
The Stranger,0,Starts great but it ultimately falls under the spell of character redention when it's not necessary. [Full review in Spanish].
The Flight Attendant,1,It’s hard to give Cuoco enough praise for what she does on screen this season.
Fleabag,1,"We all know someone like Fleabag. And we're all capable of empathy. The very existence of this show depends on it. Creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has absolute faith in us. Had she not, Fleabag wouldn't have worked."
Bates Motel,1,"For Bates Motel, such a fitting end may seem antithetical to a series with so many shocks, but it should help the series stand up over time"
Deadwood,1,"The magic isn't gone, it's just that the early fireworks are missing."
Sharp Objects,1,Adams delivers a flawless performance once more and is perhaps the female TV anti-hero we have been waiting for.
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Continues to be a great, sharply written, perfectly executed comedy."
The Nevers,0,"Truthfully, The Nevers has a lot to recommend it. But as a busy, frequently over-stuffed period sci-fi epic, it has an uphill battle ahead of it."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"Each episode ends with a song that Ronson constructs using the chosen theme, which, thankfully, it never gets in the way of the story telling and doesn't come across as gimmicky."
Legion,0,"PowerPoint surrealism hiding a total lack of imagination. Deaths don't matter, as the timeline fractures across illusions and flashbacks. There's yet another toothy shadow monster. David's face appears on lunchboxes: Mmmm, yessss, ironic merchandise."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"Today is for the people we love and the lives we share with them. With this crew by our side, anything is possible. With a good ship and better company, the sky's the limit."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Essentially it locates a sports story as a Hollywood tale, all about flash, ego and fun. Magic Johnson (Quincy Isaiah) is the leading man, with the big smile, and a showboater. You don’t need to be a basketball aficionado, but it helps."
The Right Stuff,0,"The film is great, and it makes the weaknesses of the TV show stand out all the more clearly."
The Crown,1,"The Crown takes addictive soap opera drama and elevates it to grand, cinematic heights with picturesque locations, opulent sets, well-researched costumes, and a moving score."
The Office,1,"The genius of the show is Gervais, who also writes and directs, putting the vile Brent into situations that are ripe for disaster - and promptly turn out much worse than anyone could have imagined."
My Brilliant Friend,1,Sublime television.
Arrested Development,1,"Structurally, Arrested is in better shape than it was in season four. Fans who temper their expectations for this new batch of episodes... will be happy to be back with the terrible Bluth family."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"Lizzie McGuire is still one of the most well-known and well-loved series from the Disney Channel, and for good reason. Lizzie was the everyman -- she was all of us, and we identified with her hard."
Outer Range,1,"At its best, then, the series only uses the void to imbue its more grounded themes -- grief, loneliness, faith, longing -- with a palpable eeriness"
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"There is a lot good in this second season and as far as Netflix MCU shows go, this may be the best sophomore season we've gotten. Still, they need to work on figuring out pacing..."
Steven Universe,1,"For the first time in a while, there's no way to know what's going to happen on Steven Universe -- and it's thrilling."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Here's to hoping the final eight episodes will continue to make [the Mother] invaluable to the show's story. After all, she's the reason How I Met Your Mother is great again."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Fear not, or tremble, because we now have the thrillingly brilliant Lovecraft Country...consider [that] a forewarning and a promise of shocking and twisted entertainment with a warm wet beating heart."
Silicon Valley,1,It was the perfect ending that has cemented Silicon Valley as one of the most impactful and highly relevant shows we ever had.
Cheers,1,"There were some missteps but, for the most part, the last, expanded serving of Cheers paid off in some very big and satisfying ways."
Loki,1,"If you're here for the Douglas Adams-ish satire, it's some of the most fun stuff in the MCU."
WandaVision,1,"While this won't be for everyone due to the slow-burn pacing and departure from the usual formula, WandaVision signals a bold and exciting direction for Marvel."
Scandal,1,"Fun, silly addictive Scandal was also a serious and important part of TV history."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"I admire, for its sheer, nasty audacity, the double twist that ends the story. To achieve its impact, though, the limited series requires you not merely to suspend your disbelief, but strap it to a rocket and send it to the Milky Way."
Behind Her Eyes,1,You'll either love or hate the big reveal.
Foundation,1,Silence your phones: This show demands your attention... [Full review in Spanish]
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision scratches the big-budget superhero itch we've had for a while. Its sharp and character rich writing and exhilarating action exemplifies everything the MCU does right, but it also suffers from similar weaknesses as other entries."
Stranger Things,1,"This season’s directors, including Matt and Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy, and Nimród Antal, utilize every space and factor to reflect the narrative’s nostalgic time and dazzle the loyal fans with the elaborate, emotional roller-coaster of a script."
The Offer,0,The series bombards the viewer with stylish characters with puffed-up egos who battle for control of The Godfather.
Loki,1,"The fan-favorite gets to be the protagonist -you could argue he already did it in all of the Thor movies. The show is part workplace buddy comedy, part time-travel adventure and part procedural crime investigation, with a side of Marvel superhero panache."
The Offer,0,"If The Godfather was masterful and precise despite its famously harrowed production, The Offer is amateurish and messy because of the way it uses its sure-fire assets."
Joe vs Carole,1,"Just when you think TV has nowhere to go with the antihero, along comes this American original. He’s hard to like, but good luck averting your eyes."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"It's sweet, it goes down easily, and it doesn't challenge you nearly as much as maybe it should."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Figuring out where you belong - or if you even want to belong - is a right of passage college will foist on you whether you like it or not. ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" gives that truism the right sort of fizzy kick."
Lisey's Story,1,"At the end of the day with this show, as with Stephen King's literature, I just wished I was more a fan of the genre to be able to appreciate it."
Feel Good,1,"""Feel Good"" sends up a familiar brand of generational self-righteousness, but gently, with love."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"I needed a constant supply of Red Bulls to make it through to the end. It’s the sort of series you want to thrash with a broom, hoping it will leap into some kind of life."
Titans,1,"Titans Season 3 maximizes its stellar cast to tell a compelling and emotional story of loss, love, fear, and family, refining its formula to deliver the best season of the show thus far. If you've been waiting to dive in, now is the perfect time."
The Me You Can't See,1,"Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry are utterly compelling as they discuss their past traumas and mental health challenges in their well-intentioned three-part series aiming to help viewers identify, understand and get help for mental-health issues."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"I can't help but feel that Peter Jackson could have trimmed an hour or so from the series. At the same time, I can't think of a scene I wish I hadn't seen: You need the hours to fully convey this peculiar stage in the Beatles late history in its full..."
The Undoing,1,"Guided by Susanne Bier's taut direction, the twists keep coming and nothing is quite what it seems."
Hawkeye,1,Marvel's latest offers grounded look at Avenger arrow slinger.
Little Voice,1,"Little Voice is sweet, genuine, and hopeful."
Euphoria,1,"A tough, mature season that continues to border and cross boundaries while showing introspection. [Full review in Spanish]"
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna careens all over the place, and one of its only consistencies is an exhausting insistence that Delvey was talented but misunderstood."
The Mist,0,"The horror genre is jam-packed with spine-tingling tales, which makes The Mist nothing more than a light fog."
The Witcher,1,Delightfully spooky and suspenseful.
Intimacy,0,"Heavy-handed, and some of the dialogue seems like a first draft they never polished. [Full review in Spanish]"
Suspicion,1,"Dark, driving, and addictive, this thriller casts a keen eye on modern-day surveillance and social media."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Jackson is already talking about an 18-hour director's cut, and all I can say is, don't leave me standing here. Lead me to your door."
30 Rock,0,"The good news is there's a host of amazing cameos from Salma Hayek, Julianne Moore... But they're sometimes not very funny, and the whole thing has the feel of a rushed comedy riff whipped off over too many cups of coffee."
Atlanta,1,Never explicit or obvious... [Full review in Spanish]
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision also excels as a visual history of the TV comedy, transitioning to the bright candy colors of the 1970s by the third episode (the last available for review) as the comical complications of their dislocated domesticity grow."
Inventing Anna,1,“Inventing Anna” isn’t a tough watch. The actors do a lot to compensate for what’s missing.
Unbelievable,1,One of the most comprehensive and involving examinations of crime ever presented on either the big or small screen.
Monk,1,The performance that Tony Shalhoub gave as a close-to-death Monk was simply amazing.
Alias Grace,1,It's a fantastic cast and is very well written... I was very intrigued right from the start.
Euphoria,0,It's clear Levinson and his creative crew are out of ideas. But how many did they have to start with?
What If...?,1,"Not only did What If provide us with clean stories, exciting animation, and a roster of recognizable voices, the season-long arc sent my brain into fangirl overdrive."
Peacemaker,1,"Brimming with references to D.C. characters such as Harley Quinn and Aquaman and brutally frank jokes about real-world figures, Peacemaker is a James Gunn creation through and through..."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,Hero Project's best attribute is that it lets the kids being profiled shine through.
You're the Worst,1,"There's definitely more going on in ""You're the Worst"" than clever put-downs and romantic sentimentality, though."
The OA,1,"The last episode of The OA spoke to me...I felt a wave of emotion, actually moved to tears because in that moment I saw that we are all looking for our purpose..."
Narcos,1,Keeping Pascal was important in connecting the stories and keeping an interesting presence at the center of the series.
Love Life,1,"Marcus doesn't always get it right, but this season of Love Life is sharp, funny and insightful, and Harper gives a terrific performance."
Limitless,1,The fact that Bradley is excited about what's going on -- that he doesn't get all angst-y -- is something Limitless has going in its favor.
Psych,0,"Even though it's had a successful run over almost nine years at this point, Psych looks like it's sustained by perpetual motion, not by the excitement of producing entertaining television."
Prison Break,1,"Some whoppers in terms of story and logic, but this is the long-awaited fifth season of Prison Break, after all. You expected otherwise? A solid start."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"This new show was going to be fun times again. Wrong. It's serious and, on the evidence of the first two episodes, all-over-the-place unfunny with a few joyless jokes sprinkled into it."
Succession,1,"Succession season three delivers one helluva rollercoaster ride that keeps us gasping for air between the laugh-out-loud absurdity and intensely claustrophobic, emotional and no holds barred standoffs."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,The flaws in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland appear to be fixable.
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game doesn't delve too deeply - and it's not subtle - but for a visual hammer-blow, this has made waves."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"The body of the series is a bantery young-adult soap, the head a woman-on-the-edge thriller, and the tail a race melodrama. The creator, Sarah Lampert, must have looked upon her handiwork with proud amusement."
A Wilderness of Error,1,"If you come to ""A Wilderness of Error"" looking for a definitive answer, or for some startling final-episode reveal that puts everything in a new light, you'll be disappointed."
Normal People,1,"Edgar-Jones brings a mesmerising vulnerability, while Mescal (in his breakout role) muddles the words in his mouth before he speaks, taking great care with the dialogue that Rooney uses so sparingly."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The investment in the characters, plus the fun globe-trotting action should keep viewers riveted."
Dark Winds,1,“Dark Winds” has a sensibility that draws you in and compensates for the lapses in storytelling.
Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare"" isn't just a Winslet acting exhibition, nor is it ever in danger of becoming a hollow A-list actor offensive... It's a riveting and messy family drama that's wrapped in a chewy and thrilling murder mystery."
Invincible,1,"It's hard to see exactly what ""Invincible"" wants to say with its expectation-shattering ethos, but it's certainly earns your attention."
Hawkeye,1,"The return of street-level Marvel stories is refreshing, and the Christmastime setting of Hawkeye - combined with Marvel's classic comedy - helps provide some needed levity in an otherwise dark series."
The Leftovers,1,The final season steers the narrative and the viewing faithful toward something more rewarding than the promise of an answer.
Halo,1,"While I’m not ready to get down on one knee and offer the Halo series a “sacred ring,"" I can commit to checking out more episodes as their fresh ideas unfold."
Person of Interest,1,"Mr. Emerson has to play a number of very emotional scenes with a computer monitor, carrying on passionate conversations with the blinking cursor. Not one moment of this will tempt you to laugh (in fact, you might have to blink back a tear)."
Chloe,1,"...packed with intriguing flavours, with Erin captivating with her disturbing yet somehow sympathetic portrayal of Becky..."
Devs,1,"This is peak TV in all its decadence, methodically constructed like a medieval cathedral."
Frasier,1,"Final episodes of long-running series are almost impossible to craft, and this one had its flaws. The episode never found a comfortable rhythm, which left one feeling emotionally jangled from time to time."
WandaVision,0,WandaVision is best when it embraces the idiosyncrasies that made it distinct; the show loses that flourish when it's focused on spinning six different MCU plates all at once.
Joe vs Carole,0,It has little purpose than to remind you of the first time you learned about this incredible saga.
The OA,1,"Season 2 not only gives all the returning characters great material, but also finds room to introduce Karim (Kingsley Ben-Adir), the PI who brings a much-needed audience viewpoint - and an immediate likability - to the show."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll‘s acerbic wit, sharp writing and exploration of complex themes make it endlessly rewatchable in my book."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Everything you could possibly have hoped for.
Borgen,1,It’s one of the first shows I’ve seen to reckon with the decline and fall of the archetype of the girlboss.
The Queen's Gambit,1,An intriguing exploration into the emotional price paid for genius.
Modern Family,1,"We get all 15 family members seated at the same dinner table, and it is glooooooorious."
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty is a class valedictorian at an all-night rager. It's smart, with thoughtful ideas to offer those who feel like engaging with them - but it's concerned first and foremost with having a good time."
Looking for Alaska,1,Even with its flaws - including a narrative slowdown around Ep. 4 - this is a rare teen-lit adaptation that works on multiple levels. And that's something worth looking for.
WandaVision,1,Homage in the best sense.
True Blood,0,"This is a show so stuck in a quagmire of nonsense that it introduced a ridiculous six-month time jump in last season's finale to get out of the nonsense -- and yet when the show picks up here, it becomes clear it is still stuck in a quagmire of nonsense."
Mare of Easttown,1,I’m not sure I have engaged in appointment viewing in years! It was nice to be giddy on a Sunday night for m’stories.
Lost,0,"So I've given it another day to sink in, and I'm still profoundly irritated by that ending. It rendered this whole season of Lost pretty silly. And it barely made sense on its own terms."
Castle Rock,1,"[Lizzie] Caplan, is unsettlingly good as Annie, giving a performance that can be emotionally poignant in one scene and petrifying in another, turning on a dime in an instant."
Scandal,1,"I am enjoying this Olivia Pope. When she sets her sights on something, she goes for it, and she's starting out strong this season with a clear view of what she wants."
Casual,1,For fans of the last three seasons there will be some fitting resolutions and fun surprises.
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter's two-hour premiere has set up yet another mission that has already proven to be even more exciting than last season's involving Howard Stark and Midnight Oil.
Rick and Morty,1,"The opening salvo of the new season is spectacular: insane joke density, an ever-present silliness brushing up against bad taste, awkward social situations laid bare, and hilariously tearing classic sci-fi and genre conventions a new one."
Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare of Easttown"" isn't the feel-good show of the spring season, and is dark, dirty, and depressing, but its soulfulness offers an unmistakable sentiment of hope that's hard to combat."
Sex Education,1,"As we reach the third season, it's time to say that Sex Education has passed the test. It hasn't befallen to third season syndrome, and it's kept the story consistent and informative."
The Night Of,1,"It's vital and gripping. It's not an imitator dressing itself up in the trappings of a classic HBO drama, but the real deal."
Gravity Falls,1,"I don't care how old you are, if you're not watching Gravity Falls you're missing out on some of the cleverest, most enjoyable television you can find."
Mindhunter,1,"If Season 1 of the Netflix series presented a sort of preamble to serial killer psychology, the new season expands on the mythology...If Season 1 was more theory, now it's more practice."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,A satisfying piece of entertainment and subtle social commentary.
Shadow and Bone,1,Book readers and new arrivals alike will be pleased: Shadow and Bone is an eight-episode addiction that will give you exactly what you didn't know you needed and leave you wanting more.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Prehistoric Planet offers a remarkable blend of science and spectacle: it’s ‘filmed’ in such an immersive and tactile way, and the Cretaceous period is rendered with such intricacy and substance, that you'll forget dinosaurs are extinct."
The Crown,1,"The more Gillian Anderson pops into the narrative, the more obvious she's crafted this role into the finest of an already lauded career."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"It's to early to say if the rest of the season 9 episodes will be as good, but it's always great when a show can start off strong."
Lost,0,"The producer's foolishness in deciding to mix sprinklings of false faiths in with the true not only undercut the spiritual value of the show, it undercut the entertainment value of it as well."
The Outsider,1,The revelations are delivered too slowly. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"While I cant say it was as strong as the previous live action Star Wars series that features so heavily here, I can still say it was thoroughly entertaining every week."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Short, pithy and outrageously funny."
The Stand,1,"""The Stand"" provides something trickier: plague escapism. Pandemic fantasy. That it succeeds is a testament to its author, the durability of his vision and the adaptability of his imagination."
WandaVision,1,"Fresh, original, strange, tragic, intriguing, 'WandaVision' stands in bold contrast to Marvel's previous output. That alone makes it worth watching."
Monsters at Work,1,"Like the movies, cuteness and wit combine for good children's programming."
Chucky,1,"Chucky, the new series premiering on Syfy, retains all of the character's penchant for grotesque kills and juvenile, acidic humor... Elegant, this show is not."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"...More important than that, it's a season where the women around him are discovering themselves."
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight can be summed up in a phrase - missed opportunities.
Catastrophe,1,Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney seem to have decided that four series of their sublimely delusion-free comedy about modern marriage are enough. They're so wrong.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Horror is about dark delight, yes-but it's also about intensity, a quality in extremely short supply in Hill House."
Interrogation,1,"So, while I highly recommend Interrogation for the way the crime and its aftermath unfolds and the dedicated performances by its talented cast, I have to recommend that you watch in order."
The Wonder Years,1,Saladin K. Patterson's script never loses the series' core: a family drama. [Full review in Spanish]
Slow Horses,1,This adaptation is a welcome dog-eared antidote to the shiny globe-trotting nonsenses of the Bond franchise.
Chernobyl,1,It's hard to imagine a more despairing portrait of humanity's continuing capacity to ruin itself than this account of a disaster that's three decades old.
A Very English Scandal,1,"Although A Very English Scandal will probably best be remembered for the two incredible performances at the heart of its narrative, it is also a careful study in how to balance a story in which the truth is almost certainly stranger than any fiction."
True Detective,1,"One divisive second-season later, the series is back with a whole new set of characters, but a mystery that feels elemental. Time is a flat circle, after all."
The Boys,1,"Kripke successfully maintains the series’ high caliber consistency with season three. “The Boys” continues its streak of anarchic energy, sardonic humor, and self-indulgence made all the more entertaining by its bursts of extreme gonzo violence."
The Wire,1,"... if you're looking for new episodes of the best cop show on television, well, we won't say it. Enough is enough, right?"
Devs,1,"If I've a complaint, beyond the pace, it's that [Alex] Garland is a tad too fond of weird lighting and disorientating ""ommm"" sounds when he has some heavy dramatic lifting to do."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Instead of a bang-up season, Jessica Jones drowns in a tired, overplayed question: What does it mean to be a hero?"
Veep,0,[The] opening gave me hope that I was in for a fun final ride with this crew. But it was mostly downhill from there. There was a clear inability to capture the manic energy of the best episodes when Iannucci was in charge.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Comfort blanket Trek with a great cast, snappy writing and plenty of strands to unwind in future episodes, Strange New Worlds achieves everything it intends. But there’s a lingering feeling that there’s perhaps not quite enough that’s strange or new."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The cast almost seems as bewildered as their characters, thrust as they are into this beatific place with ominous undertones. It's unfortunate that they all get off on the wrong foot with each other nearly across the board."
The Expanse,1,"The Expanse begins its final chapter with thrills and ultimatums...it's finally returned-for just six episodes, but at this point any Expanse is better than no Expanse..."
Little America,1,Little America's greatest strength is its commitment to the stories we don't hear.
Watchmen,0,On a technical level it also leaves much to be desired. [Full review in Spanish]
Shadow and Bone,1,"This is a lively ride across a rich fantasy world. It's great to see Netflix invest in exciting new young adult fantasy (which will entertain many older adults, too)."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"If the creative confidence shown by the whole Winning Time in the first seventy percent of the season is anything to go by, they will pull it out in the end. And I will be cheering them along the whole way."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,Exactly the kind of big-budget finale the show needed to go out on a bang.
The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't the first drama to make images its primary currency - from Enemy of the State (1998) back to Blow Up (1966), the genre has a distinguished lineage - but it feels like a good time to revisit it"
The Staircase,1,The Staircase gave us eight episodes of scintillating true-crime drama. It also turned wig acting into a competitive sport.
Swagger,1,"Swagger doesn't reinvent the wheel of the emotional sports drama, but it certainly knows how to fine tune the formula in a very satisfying way."
Sex and the City,1,"The show always had a realpolitik directness about such social pressures; as another HBO series put it recently, winter was coming."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"All these promising performances are set against a story that so far seems uninterested in complicating the alleged heroism of its protagonists, and that would rather dive deeper into doom and gloom."
Reacher,0,"No nuance, no depth, no originality. In other words: nothing to set it apart."
The Mandalorian,1,"The inconsistencies of the show are frustrating, but so much is forgiven by how much they nailed the relationship between our central pair."
Inventing Anna,0,"The show misunderstands what made the grifter at its center a viral sensation; for all the promise in its ripped-from-the-headlines premise, Inventing Anna is a shabby letdown."
Watchmen,1,The most admirable thing about Lindelof's Watchmen is that it channels the spirit of the original comic without merely rehashing it.
Line of Duty,1,"Its ever-rotating cast of guest stars has always been one of Line Of Duty's greatest strengths, and within two short hours, Kelly Macdonald is already shaping up to be one of the most mad and memorable."
Deadwood,1,"Deadwood suggested that, at its best, society can even us all out, can make us realize there's more to life than our own self-interest."
Mr. Corman,1,Mr. Corman is a complex character for American TV/streaming with a richly inquisitive mind.
Looking for Alaska,1,Looking for Alaska is a cup of melancholy chamomile tea sipped while staring wistfully out of a window.
Loki,1,"This delightful, thoughtful addition to the MCU brings all the quirky fun and humor of Thor: Ragnarok while deftly exploring some pretty big questions about existence and free will."
Bodyguard,1,"[Bodyguard is] one of those crowd-pleasing thrillers that manages to be both cerebral and terrible, where characters constantly do dumb things that leave you howling at the screen."
The Wheel of Time,1,Despite the flaws there's enough here that will keep viewers engrossed in the series with its expansive visuals and inherent intrigue over the mystery of the Dragon Reborn.
Behind Her Eyes,1,"By the time it's over, this sci-fi-tinged limited series becomes a buzzworthy binge, one that will likely have you thinking back to clues you might have missed along the way."
Mad Men,0,The characters got the wake-up calls last season. The writers need one this season.
Why Women Kill,1,"It’s an almost cartoonish dark farce led by a sensational cast. Tolman, whose entire demeanour changes incrementally throughout the series, is totally compelling."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,The Punisher Season 2 is a massive improvement on its predecessor and even stands head-and-shoulders above some of the other shows in the Marvel/Netlix pantheon.
Wolf Like Me,0,The show is heavy handed [...] without actually delivering
Entourage,0,The final outcomes in the series finale were predictable and saccharine.
Little Voice,1,"One thing that distinguishes ""Little Voice"" from other musical theater-meets-karaoke shows of its type is that it acknowledges its own crowd-pleasing tendencies."
Sweet Tooth,1,Sweet Tooth is a well-rounded epic that has the potential to be a long-running success for Netflix that will keep audiences entertained for seasons to come.
A Very English Scandal,1,"A funny, sad, engaging winner."
Titans,1,"By the end of its first five episodes, Titans Season 3 is the show's best version of itself, but the series has, historically, had trouble sticking the landing."
Loot,1,Maya Rudolph makes being mega-rich look fabulous as a benevolent but clueless billionaire trying to do good on 'Loot.'
The White Lotus,1,"[Murray] Bartlett and [Jennifer] Coolidge emerge early as the show's MVPs though, both offering performances that cater to their theatrical inclinations whilst remaining centred in a tragic truth."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Simultaneously downbeat and optimistic in its refusal to bring the story to an end, there's something effortlessly fitting about the way that Trek's most challenging incarnation draws to a close."
Stay Close,1,This series is good news for for Anglophiles who want to see something a bit different from the usual British crime drama.
The Ipcress File,1,The Ipcress File has the makings of a compelling espionage yarn and it may yet find its own identity.
The Man in the High Castle,0,"So while on the one hand I commend showrunner Eric Overmyer and the producers for acknowledging the role African Americans play in every freedom fight this nation has been embroiled in - even ones in fictional, ""what if"" histories - thanks but no thanks."
The Big Conn,0,A Convoluted Story Tries To Make Light Of A Real Tragedy.
Foundation,1,"At times it's imperfect, certainly, and not all of the choices work. But overall Foundation is an exciting, imaginative and intelligent space opera with a lot to offer anyone in the mood for some immersive science fiction."
Catastrophe,1,"While I enjoy Catastrophe, I'm not sure the show has ever done something that hit me as hard as its final scene."
True Detective,1,"I just wanted a moment when the characters caught their breath and didn't feel like they were part of an overly-scripted machine. Now, having said that, this is still engaging, dark, complex material, anchored by a great performance from Ali."
Shadow and Bone,1,"It doesn't feel like it's dumbed down for television audience which is nice BUT it is a bit difficult to keep up with if you have never before heard of the ""Grishaverse"" (raises hand) because you practically need a glossary of characters."
Looking for Alaska,1,"The show hit home - and not just for its throwback music and early-2000s fashion. It's poised to do the same for today's teens, for reasons that go far beyond appearances."
Dark,1,"The longer I chewed on it, the more I grew to appreciate the feat Dark pulled off with this last act."
Veep,1,In real terms Veep should be showing its age. And yet in the execution it feels as sharp as it always did. Perhaps more so given the embarrassment of riches that Washington D.C. shovels in the show's direction every day.
Stranger Things,1,"A long, scattered ride that's at times disappointing given its reputation as a streaming blockbuster that's too big to fail. But it is still very much Stranger Things, and reuniting with its characters is enough to make it enjoyable."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight has turned out to be one of the better Marvel series, mostly because it feels different. The show is supposedly set in the same universe as the Avengers, but viewers can enjoy it as a stand-alone series."
Russian Doll,1,"I never thought this season would be possible, and not only is it good but it will certainly be considered one of the best shows of 2022."
Mad Men,1,"On a show all about advertising and projecting a certain image, it's very entertaining when the show can actually play with the idea of how the media can sell us something."
Yellowjackets,1,"When it commits to its chilling suspense, the show is utterly fascinating to watch... Let's just hope the payoff, and the inevitable reveals to come, are worth the slow-burning effort."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"For every omission, there's something -- a firecracker Ike & Tina Turner performance, James Brown in Paris -- that makes you sit up and pay attention."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Most of what's in these ten episodes seems designed to get your hopes up even while the showrunners are busy dashing them, and perhaps most noticeable is the fact that the show has become more depressing and fatalistic than ever."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Nina Simone rings and For Colored Girls shouts, this is the work of art that is Lovecraft Country."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Monumental, the Mona Lisa of rock documentaries, a staggering, towering technical and artistic achievement."
Monsters at Work,0,Any hope that the Pixar charm would rub off on a Pixar show like Monsters at Work doesn't pay off in the first two episodes.
What If...?,1,"With dazzling visuals and thrilling storytelling, Marvel's new animated series follows beloved storylines to new ends and scores on every level."
The Boys,1,"The Boys continues to be one of the best series on television. Its storytelling, visual effects, one-in-a-million actors, and non-conventional humor continue to prove why the series is a fan favorite."
BoJack Horseman,1,"In the end the depressed horse show didn't just give us a way to vocalize our own vulnerabilities, insecurities, and mental anguish. It also gave us hope for a better future, as well as a guide for us all to find our own happiness."
The Old Man,1,"What makes The Old Man worth watching is not necessarily its flashback-heavy narrative, it’s the talent at its center. Bridges and Lithgow give powerful performances as two aging men whose relationship spans decades and defies explanation."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,There’s a tonal whiplash that can be perplexing. But... a delightful performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor holds the series together in ways that remain entertaining and full of potential.
Midnight Mass,1,"Flanagan's best work, whom seems to have used all of his previous projects as practice for this thrill machine, a series that broke my heart into a thousand pieces and left me thinking about his last moments long after it ended. [Full review in Spanish]"
Mr. Robot,1,"Whoever wins the David vs. Goliath battle, one thing is for certain about the final season of Mr. Robot: It's going to be a bloody Christmas."
Lost,0,"Watching ""Lost"" has been a bit like being pregnant. The thrill of discovery... Until it came down to a few final weeks, fueled by fevered anticipation and the wretched, bloated desire to just get the dang thing over with."
Waco,1,"Even with some thin characterization, the cast is star-studded and delivering their A-game. Before the guns start firing and the flames begin to burn, Waco will be wise to let their stellar actors have some quiet conversations."
The Wheel of Time,0,"This premise would, on its face, seem to lend itself well to episodic drama. And yet the series, created by Rafe Judkins, finds itself stranded on various morasses."
Rise,1,Rise is a soap opera as much as it is a prestige drama that will be a great follow-up to This is Us. So don't let the soap-opera fact deter you from giving it a shot.
Bridgerton,1,"Season two of Bridgerton still is very much steamy and sexy, between Anthonys frequent shirtlessness and, especially, because its difficult to take your eyes off of Simone Ashley and Jonathan Bailey every time their characters bicker."
The Good Place,1,The Good Place is the best series about ethics in the history of television.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Smart, addictive and flat out fun, Strange New Worlds is the best Star Trek series since The Next Generation and acts as a faithful love letter to the original."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"For a show with such a radical premise, We Are Lady Parts is effectively Modern Sitcom 101."
All American,1,"All American continues its stride in acknowledging that college is not the only path, and Layla’s talent is strong enough that she can enhance her knowledge without needing to attend school."
Rutherford Falls,1,"An endearing revisit to the world of Rutherford Falls and the Minishonka Nation. If you enjoy hot dog condiment fights, getting into the wrong funeral casket and burning toy babies while running a firefighter’s gauntlet, you’re in for a real treat."
Friday Night Lights,1,What's most remarkable about Friday Night Lights (outside of the quality of the writing and acting on the actual program) is how the show survived.
Godless,1,Unrelentingly brilliant.
Catastrophe,1,"So, the formula may be a reliable one, but no one could call Catastrophe predictable."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The purpose of Money Heist is to entertain rather than educate, and entertain it does with a story that hums along with all the thrills and twists required of a well-planned and inventively thwarted heist narrative."
Pieces of Her,0,"Pieces of Her takes a similar premise, stretches it across eight hours, largely avoids the wrenching character drama of a child learning her mother is an entirely different person, and makes it all… nice. Very nice. Too nice."
Line of Duty,1,That quick pace is the show's secret weapon.
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,Dead End: Paranormal Park is easily one of the best animated shows of the year so far. It is a fun supernatural adventure with a huge heart.
Rise,1,"There are no easy answers in Rise, but there's a lot of heart and a good deal of food for thought."
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe captured the daily texture of a marriage built on love, mean-spirited humour, clear-eyed cynicism, a deep and precise knowledge of each other's flaws, and constant, low-level fear."
The Gilded Age,0,Just what HBO ordered from the man who by now is surely actually churning this stuff out in his sleep rather than simply giving the faultless impression of it.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"If you were hoping to see this era of Marvel Television sail off in the sunset with fireworks and acclaim, you're simply out of luck. Despite falling flat throughout, a few great performances manage to save the season from complete and utter despair."
Alias Grace,1,Superb.
House of Cards,1,"As we saw last season, politics is faster than this now, an endless churn of scandal and grotesquery, and House Of Cards remains its own chilly, composed self."
Succession,1,Sometimes we are all blessed in ways we are not prepared to comprehend. It's still good to try to acknowledge it. That's all this is.
Rick and Morty,1,"A tiny, almost throwaway plot detail can mutate into a gloriously surreal digression that threatens to overwhelm the main narrative. You find this in the best Simpsons episodes too, but I've rarely seen it done with more outrageous verve than it is here."
Prehistoric Planet,1,Prehistoric Planet is a stunning feat of CGI. The dinosaurs look as real as any animal you see in a wildlife documentary. This is the point.
Barry,1,"Aside from these richly layered plot developments, the characterization and performances of Barry, Gene, Hank, and, above all Sally, help this hilarious and occasionally heart wrenching dramedy once again -- just like its title character -- hit the mark."
Shadow and Bone,1,"But while the attractions are clear, there is still the sense that this adaptation of the Grisha novel trilogy could have been so much more."
Looking for Alaska,1,"In 2019, Hulu's adaptation of the book somehow feels truer to the story Green set out to tell than the book itself."
Bridgerton,1,"I breezed through all eight episodes, never surprised, but always pleased by what I saw -- especially whenever the wonderful Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury is on screen."
Entourage,1,"We've been here before, but there's pleasure in the return trip. It feels like a reassuring final season."
Chernobyl,1,They've done a really great job depicting the emergency... [And] It's this amped-up version of the debate that we have now about issues like global warming and our inability to agree on facts apart from political spin.
11.22.63,1,"Buoyed by a period-piece narrative that, over the course of eight-plus hours, it clearly and evocatively dramatizes with equal emphasis on what-if fantasy, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and subtle emotional depth."
Mare of Easttown,1,A seven-part series whose powers derive as much from its enthralling focus on that town and its society as from the unsteady life and career of its heroine... Kate Winslet's eloquent command of the role is obvious from the outset.
Mad Men,1,Don's fears of death and the futility of his accomplishments are the natural extensions of the show's meditations on the mid-century American Dream. And yet this is territory the show has already trod over several times with Roger.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The result is deeply creepy but unexpectedly moving, especially in the series' gorgeously paced midsection."
The Big Bang Theory,1,The Big Bang Theory says goodbye with an emotional ending to leave fans with a good taste. [Full Review in Spanish]
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Season two is miles better than the first season. It's actually even mildly entertaining at times. But Iron Fist's biggest problem persists and there's little getting around it.
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision has kicked the door wide open for Phase Four of the MCU, with stand-out performances and outstanding thematic storytelling"
Forever,1,"A curious, compelling treat, which in its first three episodes manages to weave an increasingly high-concept story without losing its initial low-key charm. Hopefully it'll carry on that way forever."
Rise,1,"Like that of the New Directions on Glee, Stanton High School's drama department is made up of much diversity and various backgrounds. But watching their differences come together onscreen for one cause is truly magical."
P-Valley,1,Real-world events figure prominently as the show deftly avoids a sophomore slump and rises to its occasion.
Angelyne,1,Angelyne doesn’t debunk every myth about the local legend; no series ever could. But this technicolor portrait of Hollywood’s sweet-yet-spicy hometown hero offers something almost better.
American Auto,1,"While ""American Auto"" feels like it's having some early engine trouble, it's worth taking this new ride into the shop for a tune-up."
Landscapers,1,Landscapers so effectively portrays the Edwardses' world that we want to believe their (purported) lies as much as they do.
The Capture,1,[The Capture] leaves the viewer wanting more and boasts outstanding performances from its main protagonists.
Big Little Lies,1,"It's harder now to ignore, watching the early episodes of Season Two, that Big Little Lies is offering up some of the best psychological storytelling on television."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Green's gift is in centering Black characters in blockbuster-style epics... Here she seizes the opportunity to play around with an array of cinematic genres and tell many stories within the course of a single, season-long quest."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Sure, there are still pacing issues (13 eps is still too many), but it's also weirdly refreshing to see a season without a single cameo or surprise guest from another part of the Marvel universe."
Killing It,1,"It's easy to slide through and laugh along with the sitcom's snake-filled first season in one sitting, and to buy everything it's pitching."
The Flight Attendant,1,"While The Flight Attendant's first season had Bohjalian's book to work from, Season 2 aims to move past that completed story arc and away from the source material, but only to varyingly rewarding returns..."
Archer,1,"The first two episodes of Archer season 12 demonstrate why the series has had such longevity, with its dysfunctional ensemble delivering hilarious dialogue amid international conflict and internal backbiting."
The Boys,1,The Boys‘ third season is the most balanced to date and had me hooked from the first episode to the last and will likely have you all hoping the fourth comes sooner than later.
WandaVision,0,"As the show goes on and starts coming into focus, maybe it'll hit the vibe of that twisted Twilight Zone reality I think they might be going for here. But for my money, I think they should have hit that in the first couple episodes."
Jericho,0,"Was it good? Was it bad? For me, it was neither. It was simply ""meh,"" and I'm glad the misery is over."
The Alienist,1,"While Angel of Darkness has its blaringly anachronistic moments, it's well-tooled and visually detailed enough to keep you coming back for more genteel punishment."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Fortunately for HIMYM, the time-turning precedent for the season only strengthens such a radical episode's premise."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The overall quality of the cast adds a lot to the series, as does the idyllic setting. [It] manages keep us on tenterhooks from one episode to the next but when I sat down to reflect on what I'd seen it felt like a rather empty entertainment."
Girls,1,"The clamor about Girls may have died down, which is a relief. Based on the first three episodes, Dunham is ready to end her story with satirical precision and self-aware compassion."
Sex Education,1,"All the young actors shine, but none of them more than Ncuti Gatwa, who plays Eric with an energy and resilience that is inspiring to watch. This season, Gatwa isn't just a joy; he brings more nuance and authenticity than ever."
Moon Knight,0,"Housed within another movie stretched into a series, “Moon Knight” dulls two stars that should be lighting up the Marvel universe."
Resident Alien,1,"Resident Alien is still a hoot, and I’m digging the current “Harry in New York City” storyline. But the show isn’t perfect, and some of the human subplots have been lacking ..."
Bel-Air,1,"Whether this all adds up to something is hard to say at this juncture, but its definitely worth sticking around to find out."
Rome,1,"... with patience to reacquaint with the characters, ""Rome"" builds into a compelling, toga-clad soap opera."
Hacks,1,"If good comedy needs emotional heft, this has it to spare, and still manages to be vicious at the same time."
Chernobyl,1,"A superb and grim adaptation of infamy. HBO's Chernobyl does a fantastic job of placing us there with the victims, villains and the overwhelming sadness. [Full review in Spanish]."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The aesthetic of The Haunting of Hill House makes it work not only as horror TV, but also as a deft adaptation of Jackson."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"With its strong themes and understanding of the times, this is a must-see drama this year. This series serves a checkmate in its opening chapters."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It has the heft and depth of a great novel, going deeper and deeper into the main character and probing her soul with an outsider's keen, curious eyes."
The Staircase,1,"Startling and compelling, this true crime miniseries wrings new juice from a well-worn criminal case with deft and involving characterizations from a powerhouse cast."
Wolf Like Me,0,"""Wolf Like Me"" is more of a bummer than a fun watch."
The End of the F...ing World,1,Season 2 tells a new story that maintains the offbeat rhythm and peculiar style that made the first run a cult hit.
Justified,1,"It's interesting to see just how self-aware the premiere episode is with all the talk of Harlan practically a remnant of what it used to be, of moments in the past and the recognition of things all wrapping up."
The Night Of,0,"Its opening credits are every bit as beautiful and gritty and pretentious as, say, True Detective's, but its story is simpler and far, far worse."
Pachinko,1,"An exceptional boldness and truthfulness in vision reverberate through every layer of Pachinko: its story is full of searing humanity, its casting is thoughtful, and the project boasts a formidable multi-national team of producers, consultants, and crew."
Fleabag,1,"Season two is somehow better than the first, and Waller-Bridge's ability to blend comedy and tragedy -- often in the same scene -- makes this show unlike anything else on television right now."
Why Women Kill,1,"Tolman and Frost are delightful together, and Parilla is suitably evil in a drop-dead glamorous way."
Schmigadoon!,1,"A six-episode summer trifle... it can sometimes be a bit of a toothache, but the series is also just as often irresistible, with a tremendously committed, blue-chip cast working at the peak of their powers."
The Undoing,1,"The whole thing was delicious fun but wafer thin, as superficial as the cheer for diversity at the auction and kept afloat largely by Kidman's typically poised and enigmatic turn."
The Afterparty,1,"""Afterparty"" never takes itself too seriously and is filled with many lively and weird characters."
Landscapers,1,"Instead of a whodunnit, Landscapers instead is a pleasurable exercise in style."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"I was shockingly invested in the story after the first three episodes, in a way that almost snuck up on me."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"I'm still watching, so I guess it's good enough. But I also know it could be so much better."
After Life,1,"Season three provides a sweet and satisfying finale to a near-perfect series that warms the heart, challenges perceptions, confronts demons and, yes, makes you laugh out loud."
Westworld,0,Westworld season 4 is ... a lot.
Stranger Things,1,"On the whole, Stranger Things Season 4 is pretty good. Sometimes even pretty great."
Chucky,1,"Chucky adds some fun story elements to the ""murdering doll"" dynamic, bringing the franchise back to it's earliest days."
Lucifer,1,"Lucifer's final sendoff is at best satisfactory, elevated by the performances of its cast and the finesse of its production..."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Unlike Gerald's Game, Flanagan's greatest strength here is when he's playing with the story as opposed to being slavishly devoted to it. It's a reimagining for an era that doesn't know what that word means anymore."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"In general, the 1920s and 30s are such an underexplored period in television that all of the historical and cultural touches scattered throughout give the show a patina of freshness"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Combining this cast with these creators and a bestselling novel adaptation are the ingredients for success, but it falls short with its story."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sorry, reader and watcher, Nine Perfect Strangers is a snoozefest."
Bates Motel,1,It's amazing Bates Motel ended as well as it did.
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The series is never so engrossing that you forget about Clare and Henry’s interactions when she is a child. There is always that niggly feeling it’s not quite right, and the show doesn’t do enough to assuage that impression."
Adventure Time,1,"As heartbreaking, adventurous and inventive a conclusion as the show deserves."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"But it's a series that will stick in people's minds - not because of the familiar things it does, but for all the things it dares to do differently."
Amazing Stories,1,"On balance, a solid effort."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Full of drama, tragedy and unease, but with a hint of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
Starstruck,1,"Once the last episode's end credits roll this time around, you'll be reminded of exactly why you fell in love with Starstruck in the first place, too."
The First,1,"Sadly mistaken for a full on sci fi epic, The First is a drama quest on our limits and emotions. Sean Penn shines. [Full review in Spanish]."
Peacemaker,1,"Huge, irresistibly silly fun."
24,1,"It was worth the wait, and the wait was good all around."
House of Cards,1,"Their tense, hostile intimacy is a bit like Feud or Big Little Lies - a refreshing change from Spacey's egomaniacal, spotlight-hogging male energy."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"It’s not as good as Big Little Lies by a long shot, but it does scratch the same itch."
The Undoing,0,"The story has gossipy moms, an elite school and a murder investigation. Yet neither the sharp performances nor the lush window dressing can save scripts that have so little to say."
Inventing Anna,1,"""Too bad the series wastes s so much time on the whiny, annoying journalist (Anna Chlumsky), rather than brazen, manipulative Anna and her gullible victims."""
The X-Files,1,"Season 11 so far isn't flawless, but it's a lively, character-focused affair that feels far more unified than we'd ever anticipated, a massive improvement over Season 10 that gives us genuine hope for the second half."
Halo,0,How the show is written demonstrates a very rudimentary style of storytelling that values embellished dramatic flare over an authentic episodic experience.
Brave New World,1,"""Brave New World"" isn't bad - what remain of Huxley's central ideas here are still relevant and important. They're just presented in a such a muted way you wind up thinking of another Rolling Stones song, about wanting more satisfaction."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"After years of up-and-down, divisive, serialized storytelling, the latest ‘Star Trek’ series triumphantly returns the franchise to its familiar, episodic roots."
Veep,1,The ride is so fun and the writing so sarcastically clever.
Mindhunter,1,The show's second season reveals the intricate intersections between personal and political neuroses.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"[It] unfolds at too plodding a pace... But once the series establishes its storytelling approach, it hooks you in, compelling you to keep watching until certain mysteries are resolved."
Doom Patrol,1,"Michelle Gomez's arrival on Doom Patrol is pitch-perfect, just like she is."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Its exploration of why women often feel more alienated from than connected to one another is far from lean-in aspirational, but at least it's honest."
BoJack Horseman,1,"It's a beautiful, life-affirming end to one of the greatest TV shows of our time."
Bel-Air,0,"Peacock’s reimagining of the ’90s sitcom goes over the top with drama, conflict and heavy-handed symbolism."
Heroes,0,"Ideas so ill-conceived and poorly executed, you'd think the show was written by committee and the writers had given up-really been phonin' it in there for quite some time."
Taboo,1,"If you like your historical fiction grim and your cobblestones dirt-caked, if you don't mind looking into some of humanity's bleaker facets, this one's for you."
The Witcher,1,"The Witcher continues to be a light and entertaining adventure in its second season, despite some lingering pacing issues."
24,1,"Having long since proven that they can indeed fill 24 episodes with action, cutting it in half gives the creators the chance to cut the fat and deliver a lean, mean ride."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"While Little Fires Everywhere has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it's also remarkably understanding of the people within it."
Silicon Valley,1,"All the studies, initiatives and op-eds about this persistent discrimination are fine, but what really works in our world is the stinging bite of satire."
Watchmen,1,"From squid storms thanks to Adrian Veidt (you'll have to do a bit of background research into that one), to horrific gun fights under a lookalike Owlship, it's a harrowing tone overall, which is a suitable homage to past Watchmen material."
The Right Stuff,0,This series plays like a quickly-written nostalgia trip and nothing more.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,Bernthal's gravelly voice and thoughtful delivery continue to help uplift even the most melodramatic Frank lines.
Severance,1,"Black Mirror meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in a gender bender series with incredible aesthetics and a captivating story that borrows Sci Fi elements to tackle memories, affection, boredom, work routine and corporative bureaucracy."
MacGruber,1,"I’m happy to report that MacGruber the series, which picks up after its lead has spent more than ten years in prison, is an improvement even on the movie."
Chuck,1,I enjoyed the hell out of that.
Breaking Bad,1,"For strength and purity of vision, for its unique calibration of its core character, Gilligan's magnum opus is unsurpassed."
Loki,1,"Nothing can prepare you for Loki, a mind-bending dive into the Marvel Multiverse that takes everything you thought you knew about the MCU and turns it on its head for one of the most ambitious, craziest stories Marvel Studios has ever told."
The Night Of,1,"A gripping collision of race, religion, justice, incarceration and violence wrapped into a modern-day murder mystery, The Night Of may be the best limited series HBO has pulled off since the first season of True Detective."
Big Little Lies,1,"It was the mother of all TV blockbuster finales, with one explosive secret revealed after another."
Atlanta,1,"Season 3 has found the show’s core cast enjoying more success than ever. As the installment’s unorthodox storytelling exemplifies, fame makes the Black experience that much more confounding."
Mr. Corman,1,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his creative cohorts have created a weird, wild, and wonderful series that ranks among the most ambitious series of the year, if not the decade and/or this century."
The Queen's Gambit,1,An intelligent and personal period piece.
The Alienist,1,"Just when you think that The Alienist couldn't possibly get any darker, it does."
Lisey's Story,1,"Totemic language and objects abound in Lisey's Story...bring their winding, disorienting drama to life with misty, shadowy, shimmering beauty."
The Stand,1,"I genuinely did enjoy the first four episodes. But it's by episode five where I start to turn around, but because it's King, I still want to see these built-up characters follow through..."
Hellbound,1,Hellbound is a nasty piece of work that starts off fascinating and then blends its genre elements with its philosophical concepts into an unwieldy blend of thrills and heady ideas that land somewhat inertly by its conclusion.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"[Writer/Director Nida] Manzoor pens a thoughtful, dynamic story about a group of women that long to be heard, and she knocks it out of the park... In addition, the soundtrack is infectiously top-notch."
Chernobyl,1,"Director Johan Renck distils dread from every shot of drifting smoke, sifting particles and insidiously seeping waters."
The Wire,1,"This season, series creator David Simon has added an extra layer of interest by focusing on his newspaper roots. This season also is less complicated than past seasons."
Stranger Things,1,"For every welcome moment of dread and (fortunately) equal moment of comedy, not to mention some cool monsters, there are sequences that remind us of just how much is going on. It’s a lot to remember, but if you’re a diehard, it’s no doubt worth it."
WandaVision,1,"An ingenious trip to the past from a modern vision, under a facade that conceals a fascinating Marvel Universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
Bridgerton,0,"All the crowded balls, deer hunts and horse races in the world can’t distract from the second iteration’s greatest disappointment: its utter expectedness."
Legion,1,"[Noah] Hawley's faithfulness to being as weird and infuriating as possible until the end is admirable. And when it's working, as it does so often throughout season 3, it's easy to get swept up in the freewheeling creativity of it all."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"The critical disdain and indifference the show has experienced is its longest, most obsessive running joke, on itself, but also on its detractors. After 12 years, ""The Big Bang Theory"" gets the final ""Bazinga!"""
WandaVision,0,"Despite some fun performances, Stark Industries cameos, and a hefty homage to past generations of television, it's tiresome... Slightly confounding expectations become the quicksand here."
P-Valley,1,P-Valley season two is full of emotional roller-coasters and character situations that the fans have come to expect and love.
Mr. Robot,1,[Sam] Esmail is one of the few series creators to expertly utilize classic analog cinematic techniques to make the conceptual oppression of surveillance state palpable.
Schmigadoon!,1,"Much like its Apple TV+ counterpart ""Ted Lasso,"" this is a series that's optimistic and uplifting."
Stranger Things,1,"“Stranger Things” might be bigger and more expensive than ever, but it hasn’t lost its touch and hasn’t forgotten where it came from."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere is rarely provocative. But not for nothing, it's better at engaging with race and class than Big Little Lies was."
Guilty Party,0,"Guilty Party, which swings from black comedy to high-stakes drama without finding its desired sweet spot somewhere in between, just keeps giving in to Beth's worse instincts without giving its audience any real reasons to care."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"If perhaps the weakest season so far by a nose, The Umbrella Academy’s third go-around largely reaffirms the show’s singularly irreverent spirit."
Station Eleven,1,"It achieves its own beauty and coherence, embodying Mandel’s point about the importance of art adapting to the circumstances of the moment."
Halo,0,"Even to an Xbox novice, the idea of Master Chief on the run already sounds like it's not HALO."
Mare of Easttown,1,"With the aid of an excellent ensemble cast, Kate Winslet inhabits Mare Sheehan and invites viewers to share her journey."
The Sopranos,1,"Its final season mostly crackled, with the usual superior performances and writing from actors James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, and creator David Chase... For now it's curtains on an extraordinary achievement."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Chess may be the central subject of this spectacular Netflix series, but make no mistake in thinking that The Queen's Gambit is solely about this game of strategy. It's about so much more."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"These three feature-length episodes are some of the purest documents of the creative process, the musical equivalent of Michelangelo discovering the sculpture that was always in the block of marble from the start."
Stay Close,1,"See you for the next episode, plus the six after that - and there's no point pretending otherwise."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Thanks to an appealing young star, a flashback-heavy structure, reassuring narration and a bright aesthetic, ""Sweet"" achieves the tricky art of a high-concept, family-friendly fantasy series."
The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones is nothing if not entertaining, shot slick and edited sharp; it's no chore for anyone seeking a chaperoned visitor's pass to music history."
WandaVision,1,"The more unexplained moments the show throws at us, and the more it pushes up against what feels like horror, the more it allows the sitcom device to really hammer home its uncanny artificiality."
The Crown,1,"While I have no doubt Imelda Staunton will be terrific in the final seasons, The Crown has a way of making you regret the inevitable march of time."
Reacher,1,"From the writing to the acting and direction - Reacher is the perfect adaptation of this beloved character that will keep you enthralled from start to finish, sticks the landing and will leave you wanting more."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Even if Valhalla never quite reaches the heights of the Vikings mothership, the show it settles into becoming is pretty strong and satisfying on its own."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The screen-popping show blends racial drama with gory horror, taking on a style that's ever-changing but always watchable."
Bridgerton,1,"For all its sexy delights, Season 1 is much shakier than this more confident and more restrained second season."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"[It] works as both a great horror story and a compelling family drama, effectively exploring how the ghosts of our pasts are just as scary as what goes bump in the night."
The Mandalorian,1,"Seeing something you love get such a well crafted, scripted, directed and acted show made it impossible to wipe a smile from my face for hours after watching every episode..."
Bel-Air,1,Bel-Air is an inspiring reflection of the interconnected power and joy-based resilience that is Black America.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Ingelsby has crafted a terrific character study that's even better as a slow-burning thriller, with the tone of a moody British mystery transplanted to the Northeast."
WandaVision,1,"The two leads are surrounded by a strong cast that includes Kathryn Hahn as Agnes, the neighbor who's up in everyone's business and delivers her lines as if they're sliding out the side of her mouth. She's perfect."
We Own This City,1,"It’s easy to keep pace with We Own This City, even as it’s difficult to fathom the breadth of police corruption outlined here—even though we know all of this really happened."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,I couldn't possibly fathom how perfect each character would pan out. Everyone had a voice; every creature had a purpose and meaning... This story moved and kept us moving right along with it from beginning to end.
Landscapers,1,Probably the least surprising feature of the series is just how good Colman and Thewlis are as the codependent couple.
Devs,0,"The show is what it wants to be, but what it wants to be put me in mind of the big whiffs of the immediate post-Sopranos era, a hefty, pretentious, high-profile exercise in trying to make you Google de Broglie-Bohm theory."
Mr. Corman,1,"As director, Gordon-Levitt switches fluently from the macro to the micro, from Instagram to astronomy, a global pandemic to one person's unshakeable unease."
Deadwood,1,"What makes Deadwood different from earlier revisions is that it not only that it blurs the lines of right and wrong, good and evil, but erases them entirely."
Breaking Bad,1,"Is the show a critique of the devastating potential of frontier masculinity or is it itself a masculine fantasy?... At this point, it seems that it wants to be both."
Detroiters,1,"When Comedy Central picked it up for this second season, it gave Detroiters a second chance to become what it deserves to be - the kind of beloved series that friends and co-workers eagerly recommend to each other."
Bridgerton,0,"Even at its best, Bridgerton was never high-minded in what it had to offer, but at least it was a harmlessly salacious good time. Now that’s gone, the period drama is little more than a glass of champagne carelessly left out all night."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"What makes ""The Queen's Gambit"" so satisfying comes in large measure from the character Taylor-Joy brings to screen: a charming, elegant weirdo who delivers her lines with a cool, wintergreen snap, and never really reacts the way one might expect."
The Nevers,0,It just feels like there is thirty percent too much plot and rabbit holes not connected to other plot lines. ... It is just a bit too weighted down.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Sheridan and his writers deal so much in shades of gray and blurred lines that it becomes impossible to make out any of the larger themes.
Castle Rock,1,"Despite some potential lost, we still got a character-driven, compelling season, with the sensation of something old, dreadful and especially eerie seeping out of the history of Castle Rock into its new inhabitants."
Reacher,0,"Ritchson has the swagger to be an intimidating action hero. His introductory scenes are most effective when he stares down cops and random bullies silently. Unfortunately, once he starts speaking, the show feeds him nothing but cheesy lines."
Safe,1,"It's really rather good, and both Hall and Abbington are superb to watch, fine actors adding texture to the wildly twisted plotting and the gusty dialogue that would make many actors knackered."
The O.C.,0,"Think of ""The O.C."" as a music video and it's less painful."
Undone,1,"This moving, beautifully animated drama explores grief, regret, acceptance and abandonment with haunting intensity."
Chloe,1,"It is a fierce, fresh sort-of-murder-mystery that is as keenly scripted as it is paced, and whose many threads are held firmly together by an outstanding performance from Erin Doherty."
Gordita Chronicles,1,A big-hearted charmer.
The White Lotus,1,"A snapshot of awfully rich people doing awfully awful things, White Lotus is delightfully mean-spirited and unexpectedly big-hearted in ways that will probably polarize some audiences. I found it vibrantly messy and deceptively emotional."
Harlots,1,"Harlots proves it can still do what it does best, which is explore its themes with humor as it gives its female characters some very real obstacles without reducing them to outright victims."
Severance,1,"A very stimulating head trip of a social sci-fi that’s willing to plumb its poignant premise for as much eerie intrigue as possible, and I’d highly recommend jumping on board."
Saved by the Bell,1,Television reboots trade off the public's long-running familiarity with their stars; kudos to this one for allowing Berkley Lauren the chance to turn the page.
Shameless,1,The swan song of the Emmy winner still has some surprises up its stain-tattered and still glorious sleeve.
Fleabag,1,"Clifford and Waller-Bridge are a transcendent sister act. And the spiritual plotline is transgressive, even Bergman-esque."
Squid Game,1,Squid Games takes a fresh idea and spins it into a thrilling drama; we hope it continues to build the tension we saw in the last 20 minutes throughout the season.
Hellbound,1,Will Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho's new streaming horror series be the next Squid Game?
Limitless,1,Limitless makes for a lively show with an addictive potential.
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone succeeds where so many fantasy adaptations fail if you stay with it and understand that it requires a bit of patience. It takes inventive writing and great acting to really bring a world to life like this.
The OA,1,"The second season continues to blur genres, jump into surprise directions, and thrill in its visual palette, but an air of pretension, and the occasional baffling moment, holds the show back from entirely resonating on an emotional level."
Amazing Stories,0,The series apparently cost $5m per episode. It's hard to see where the money went. Certainly not on the script.
Entourage,1,"Luckily for us, this finale was everything the audience hoped it would be. When the credits first rolled, I had a huge smile on my face"
Loot,1,"Loot sounds like a one-note joke on paper... Stick with it, though, and this showcase for Maya Rudolph as a billionaire minted through divorce becomes a sweet if fairly conventional romantic comedy with a few welcome surprises."
The Crown,1,Sheesh. It's still a great watch.
Rome,1,"""Rome"" dramatizes, among other things, the birth of politics as usual -- and dramatizes it with the flourish of high drama and the urgency of tonight's headlines."
Loki,1,"With Hiddleston's assured performance at the center, ﻿Loki﻿ gets off to a promising start with a twisty mystery and fascinating world-building."
Girls5eva,1,Girls5eva is the comedy oasis the world needs right now.
God's Favorite Idiot,0,God’s Favorite Idiot feels too casual for its own good.
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty is a 7/10 show with a cast that'll make you wish it was a 9/10 show - it's good, but you can't help but be disappointed it's not that little bit better."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"This is a serious, talky two-hander with very little distraction from the horrible emotional work of extricating your life from someone else's -- but in the hands of Chastain and Isaac, two magnetic actors at the top of their game, it's hard to look away."
Chloe,1,So disturbing it will scare you off social media...
Fargo,1,"Back for its fourth season, the important good news is this iteration of Fargo is significantly better than the disappointing third season, though probably not as good as the near-perfect second season."
Dave,1,"With more focus and subtlety than before, the new season of Dave proves this is a series worth your time. And let's be honest, those stupid jokes still make us belly laugh."
The Stranger,1,"A clever, mystery thriller, that doesn't reveal its secrets until it absolutely has to."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is a wholly enjoyable, family-friendly comic book TV series that features amazing performances from its leads, and sets the stage for future stories in a way that's left us anxious to return to this weird, charming world."
Night Sky,1,“Night Sky” has a tendency to meander... but we remain involved mainly because of the opportunity to enjoy Spacek and Simmons at the top of their respective games.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,How is Nine Perfect Strangers such a hot mess?
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"In Peter Jackson's hands, this three-part documentary is too long and winding for all but the biggest Beatles fans, but it's also fascinating, funny, and as sad as watching a marriage implode."
Chappelle's Show,0,"Without the full force of [Dave] Chappelle's soaring comedic vision, The Lost Episodes is merely a frustrating reminder of great promise unfulfilled."
House,0,This once-venerable hit is suffering from a serious case of been-there-itis.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,"I want to believe this dire six-part action movie was just an unnecessary origin story, a very long prologue to an actual new kind of adventure about the first Black Captain America's difficult journey through a difficult world."
Westworld,1,"The show has earned a reputation for being too elaborate for its own good; at its core, though, Westworld is stubbornly simple. Four seasons in, it’s stopped trying to say anything new."
The Right Stuff,1,"Where Staples' show really cooks is in the dynamic between the 7, in all their testosterone-fueled competition."
Midnight Mass,1,No work has so passionately tapped into the [recent] anxieties of Christianity...Mike Flanagan's religious allegory is essential viewing for Christians in America.
The Great,1,"A tonal marvel as usual, The Great has returned in even finer form."
Breaking Bad,1,"I line up diligently each Sunday, like a junkie twitching for her next fix, and I and my fellow addicts bask in 44 minutes of simply amazing television."
Limitless,0,"It's relatively engaging and slickly produced, with effective visuals showcasing Eddie's new talents, but the side effect of this show may be fatal blandness."
X-Men,1,"It's got quite the legacy, and, like many of the other shows on this list, I can attest to its success in introducing these characters to a whole new generation."
1883,1,1883 tells a much grittier and more violent story that highlights the lawlessness of the wild west and the harsh realities of late-19th century life.
Guilty Party,0,"Unlike Only Murders in the Building, Guilty Party doesnt seem to have much to say about true crime beyond just using it as a backdrop for comedy and mystery...At the very least, Kate Beckinsale is as good as ever."
A Very English Scandal,0,"It's an enjoyable romp, forgettable candyfloss, although it struggles to stop short of proselytising about homosexuality. If you want to say something serious about gay rights, this is not the story."
Suspicion,0,"There are bare minimum levels of intrigue, and fans of the genre might even enjoy the ride, but Suspicion has nothing to offer besides an average suspense story."
13 Reasons Why,1,"It's not always successful, but it does have its moments, offering up some refreshing character journeys along the way. As for some of the more infuriating moments, they are, as always, elevated by an incredibly talented cast."
You,1,"YOU Season 3 is the strongest season yet, and somehow, the premise is not derivative of itself."
Westworld,1,A meditative ride that keeps the synapses firing.
Stranger Things,0,"The new season stretches out the most basic plot lines beyond their breaking point, the most unbearably dull belonging to David Harbour’s former chief of police Hopper. He cheated death during last season’s finale to end up in narrative purgatory."
The Stand,0,"Forging a connection with the characters carries the series to a point, but it only takes a few episodes to realize that there isn't much to build toward in the lead-up to the story's inevitable confrontation between good and evil."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"For Inside Amy Schumer to bounce back, it perhaps needs to veer away from her newfound superstardom and back toward the blunt, abrasive honesty that made her a success to begin with."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"In the second season, the Arconia continues to be a portal to much wider worlds."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Thorpe was a thoroughly bad egg, but thanks to Grant's mesmerising performance, one you're happy to spend some time with."
The Queen's Gambit,1,Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't make a single false move in The Queen's Gambit.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Kidman, meanwhile, is clearly having a grand old time as the increasingly unhinged Masha, bathed in an otherworldly glow. It's hardly her most subtle work, but she steals every scene with the sheer force of her weirdness."
Bridgerton,0,"Now that we’ve all binged the new season of Netflix’s Regency romance, let’s unpack the biggest disappointment: How did our beloved Penelope become the absolute worst?"
Ramy,1,"The best television finds a way to make the specific universal and the universal specific. There is no other show quite like Ramy, because there is no other character quite like Ramy."
The First,0,"A jaunt to the stars may be forever memorable, but there's something about The First that makes it disappointingly easy to forget."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Won't quite change the narrative around The Beatles's dissolution, but it does recast the Fab Four's death throes in a much more complex, and often unexpectedly joyous light."
The Legend of Korra,1,"I appreciate Book 4 [for] putting one of its central conflicts front and center from the start, and delineating the two sides very clearly."
Alias Grace,1,"What makes Alias Grace so compelling is Grace herself, and the way her complicated life speaks to how murky the truth can become when bias, skepticism, and basic human instinct get twisted up in knots that can't be untangled."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a wonderfully sweet story for teens across the spectrum of queerness. It is multiculti, bright, tangible, and a really lovely maybe-might-be-in-love story."
His Dark Materials,1,"Luxury casting has its drawbacks... On series two, it simply means we don't see enough of James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Conversely, sometimes there's rather too much background pushing its way to the foreground."
The First Lady,0,"Unfortunately, while all three actors' performances are excellent, they can't save a jumbled series that never fully comes together."
Ozark,1,"If weve learned anything from Ozark is that no reward comes without startling losses, unpredictable twists, and the sinking feeling that peace of mind is an unachievable high."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is an extremely satisfying experience - not just for its storytelling, but for its depiction of women who confront their reality rather than succumbing to it."
Waco,0,"Despite a partially successful attempt to set the record straight, Waco too rarely offers the kind of depth that would make the examination of these powerful motivations compelling."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"This overly dramatic exposure of americana stays calmly in its conflict, but guarantees an effective show with enough social commentary even when it's not relevant. [Full review in Spanish]."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider offers terrific performances, beguiling yet careful storytelling, and no shortage of genuinely terrifying moments."
Chloe,1,"This is a fresh, invigorating spin on the psychological thriller, full of surprises and with an outstanding lead performance by Doherty."
WandaVision,1,"That said, the show does a great job of reintroducing fans into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it sets the table nicely for any new fans to the superhero genre who are just interested in a new series (even if you're not interested in superhero films)."
Rise,1,"When Rise finds its stride and lets its kids hit their high notes, it can be breathtaking. But the show has one huge anchor of a problem that keeps it from truly taking off. Rise's supposedly inspirational teacher is a patronizing nightmare."
Severance,1,"It’s hardly the first satirical take on office life but slick direction and an endlessly compelling, frequently weird premise make Severance worth calling in sick for."
Chernobyl,1,It's a real-life disaster movie that you can't tear yourself away from.
We Own This City,1,"This horrifying story will more than reward you, once you tune in to its beat."
The Nevers,0,"Who is The Nevers for? So far, not me."
The Offer,1,Brings to us an almost unbelievable story. All kinds of authenticity going on here from the period perfect costumes and sets.
Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon also succeeds at the level of breathtaking spectacle. After a stuttering first season, a would-be blockbuster has belatedly but emphatically achieved lift-off."
Waco,0,"It's so busy delivering Spam-sized chunks of ham-fisted dialogue defending the misunderstood Koresh, it loses all those other critical threads that make Waco a cautionary tale for all sides."
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is a perfectly calibrated thriller that cleverly builds up the tension so you're always questioning what you see and hear, puzzling over everyone's motivations and real loyalties, and to hook you from beginning to end."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,It isn't a spoiler to point out that what was true from the beginning holds true now: creator Julian Fellowes seems to love these characters and he seems determined to do right by them.
The Gilded Age,0,"""The Gilded Age"" feels remarkably inert, even dreary, for a story set in America's most exciting city in a period of turmoil."
You,1,"The result is schlocky, subversive fun, a series that, while certainly not for everyone, even if you're not already a fan, could become your new obsession, at least until the return of the real Dexter next month."
Inventing Anna,1,"Despite the lies and the fraud, Inventing Anna remains mostly light and even campy."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The coincidences in the plot are too good to be true,  but the acting of all involved raises the level of enjoyment."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"I'm not a superfan of Star Wars animated series, but I am impressed with this one, a team of certifiable rejects, each with their own skillset, is a winning formula for me - excellent actually"
Shadow and Bone,1,"God, it feels great to watch a solid, interesting fantasy series with all the makings of an epic hit again."
Succession,1,Triumphant return of TVs best.
What If...?,1,"It's clever as hell, daring in its alternate realities being served up, and produced with the state-of-the standards you'd expect from Marvel and Disney."
Amazing Stories,1,Reasonably diverting and ultimately quite touching.
BoJack Horseman,1,"In the end, this is a show about growth, and Season 6 proved that the series evolved along with its characters."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Season 6 has a steady, startling throughline: BoJack is trying."
11.22.63,1,"The pilot was an absolute home run, setting up a slate of fascinating characters with complex dynamics and a world of opportunity."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"This is one of the biggest contributions that The Clone Wars brings to the Star Wars franchise. While the series rehabilitates the weaker parts in the Prequel trilogy, it breaks away from the light-vs.-dark dichotomy that defines the franchise."
Sex and the City,1,"At its best Sex is always a celebration of womanhood, with or without men, and that point of view comes joyously through this season."
Ozark,1,"Think you know whats going to happen? Yeah, so did I."
Hawkeye,1,Its low-key vibe is precisely what makes it feel special.
The Undoing,1,"However, here the chief delight was also reassuringly familiar: watching wealthy people having a terrible time."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"The humour is scalpel sharp, and the cast, Whishaw to the fore, perfect fits for their roles. Like the book, the drama can switch in a heartbeat from comedy to tragedy and back again without missing a beat."
Waco,0,"While Shannon's performance is full of the strengths that have made The Shape of Water star such a sinewy actor, there isn't much acknowledgement in this small-screen version of the complexities of what really went down."
The Crown,1,"In season four, the show's resemblance to The Godfather is more pronounced than ever. The royals have more in common with a crime family than they'd perhaps like to believe, but at least the Corleones cared for each other."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,"What's more frustrating at this point is, despite everything raised in the series so far, the emphasis of the show always leads back to the ethical dilemma about how we fight instead of who we fight for."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"The Vampire Diaries premiered for the eighth and final time. Written by the show's creators, Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, the episode delivered nostalgia, horror, romance, friendship, brotherly love, and new mysteries."
Bodyguard,1,"She's older, upper class, English, and female; he's younger, working class, Scottish, and male. There's 50 shades of ""ma'am"" in the way he addresses her."
Jericho,1,"Was this resurrection worth the effort? In a word, yes."
The Staircase,0,"Yep, television has officially eaten itself."
The Sopranos,1,Mr. Chase wanted to end his tale without melodrama or even a splashy denouement. He succeeded.
We Own This City,1,"Simon, creator of The Wire, returns to Baltimore... to piece together the fragments of a broken city and turn them into an exquisite televisual mosaic."
Six Feet Under,1,"Six Feet Under achieved a rare moment of perfection in finality, ending with a true conclusion that answering the audience's questions about the characters' fates, and even answering questions that they had not known to ask."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth feels awfully familiar at first, and then goes places that surprise and delight."
Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven is a slow burn. The first few episodes look beautiful but move at a stately pace. If you can stick with it, you will be rewarded."
Midnight Mass,1,"Mike Flanagan is known for inventive, effective storytelling, and Midnight Mass still exceeds expectations. The atmospheric horror is arresting, the production design is stunning and meticulous. It's truly a masterpiece."
God's Favorite Idiot,1,"Falcone and McCarthy are great to watch, and the central relationship between their alter egos gives the whole thing enough charm, warmth and heart to get by."
Halo,1,"Having seen roughly two hours of Halo, I am confident enough in it to say that I will be sticking around to finish the fight."
Shadowhunters,1,"Shadowhunters may have given us a pretty dark episode, what with Jace turning out to be the person under the Owl's mysterious mask all along - more on that later - but at least it was tempered with some adorable domestic Malec moments."
"Love, Victor",0,"Love, Victor’s unfocused final season muddles everything that made the show successful in the past with a wide array of subplots that don’t earn an emotional connection."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"The series keeps the same charm and intrigue in its second installment. Hoffman and co. continue to explore the generational divide of the three lead characters and how one shared interest can create an unlikely, endearing friendship that defies age."
Supernatural,1,"In classic Supernatural form, it was funny, filled with love, and downright devastating."
Somebody Somewhere,1,Everett confidently holds the center of the seven-episode semi-autobiographical show...
Loki,1,"""WandaVision"" and ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" had major success earlier this year, but I could argue ""Loki"" is more interesting. An emotional character study that presents Loki with his biggest obstacle yet: himself."
11.22.63,1,"There is still so much story to tell in 11.22.63, so many triumphs and mischances awaiting, but ""The Rabbit Hole"" started on such strong footing that the rest of the journey feels like it's in the bag."
Tokyo Vice,1,"The lush look and cultural immersion make for a gripping drama, though Ansel Elgort is more of a blank slate than a charismatic lead."
Tokyo Vice,1,"A feast for those enjoying suspense, detective stories, and a taste at Japanese culture"
Angelyne,1,Maybe Angelyne is an idol made of plastic. But what’s so great about authenticity?
Watchmen,1,Never did I think a show that discusses inter-dimensional squid-beings would also create poignant commentary about America's violent racist history and how that trauma is carried on through generations.
The Twilight Zone,1,"Judging from the handful of overlong episodes made available ahead of launch, the new Zone is still rather a mixed bag, though one brimming with imaginative pleasures and smart casting."
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky has the lugubrious pace of a show built for binging while multitasking. The upside of Night Sky's 8-episode length, though, is that it showcases two incredible performances by world-class actors Spacek and Simmons."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror."
Arrested Development,1,"With a comedic cast this talented - together, they achieve banana-stand levels of reliability - there will always be good stuff."
Angelyne,1,"[Spicer and Tcherniak] can’t always build momentum in the series’ sluggish openers, but as the series gets loopier, with sci-fi elements and Brechtian theatrical pastiche, they hold the mish-mash between drama, comedy and anything-goes together."
Dinosaurs,1,"The series finale of the family-friendly dino sitcom ended on, quite possibly, the most depressing note in TV finale history."
The Staircase,1,"Intriguing, absorbing, raw, and fascinating… One of the best true crime miniseries we’ll see this year. [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,A sorry end to a landmark franchise.
Casual,1,"The season leads you down the rabbit hole toward what would be a cliche happy ending for some of these characters, but like quintessential Casual, what you expect to happen doesn't always happen."
Black Summer,1,"Don't be gulled by ""zombie apocalypse."" This ain't The Walking Dead or any of its spinoffs. It's formally brilliant, politically loaded, terse and mind-blowing."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"The brilliant documentary, directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio delights and instructs."
Dr. Death,1,Jackson is great as a wannabe genius descending into a self-created hell.
Devs,0,The mysteries of Devs don't unspool so much as eke out in a torturously slow drip. And the show's aesthetic details feel so detached from the story that they're often insufferable.
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a wonderfully heartwarming, tender and game-changing coming-of-age romance which will undoubtedly win over a whole new fan base."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's possible to admire the artistry and hard work that went into this production without feeling truly engaged by it, either emotionally or intellectually."
Severance,1,Really spooky fabulous.
Yellowjackets,1,The season climaxes with a bravura sequence of desire and ultraviolence...
MacGruber,1,"It's almost impossible to describe a big chunk of what makes MacGruber enjoyable without just listing off a string of jokes that Forte, Wiig, and a handful of other lucky guest stars get to toss in the mix."
The Offer,0,"The Offer is an illustrated Wikipedia entry stretched illogically to 10 hours by pandering to cinema fans with endless winking and nudging, and with performances that range from likably cartoonish to Madame Tussauds in a heatwave."
Doctor Who,0,"I struggled to care about this meandering story, which involved John Bishop looking as if he’d fallen on hard times and gone into panto in a pirate costume from Aldi."
The Wheel of Time,1,"There's more to explore if you want it, but for casual viewers, much of the ancillary information is either doled out when it's important to know, or is glossed over because it would otherwise bog things down."
Homeland,1,"The first three episodes are a bit clunky, with Carrie's familiar pattern of alienating nearly everyone she meets kicking in again - and then Episode 4 comes along and ""Homeland"" finds its groove."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is a sweeping epic filled with fantastic performances and a captivating story of survival. The entire ensemble is excellent, especially with Youn Yuh-Jung and Lee Min-ho showcasing their immense talent."
We Own This City,1,You'll never watch another cop show the same way again.
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Iron Fist's second season is infinitely more aware of the property's inherent narrative snagging points than the first, but rather than avoid them altogether, it makes a valiant effort of actually trying to mold them into something."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,You are witnessing unalloyed genius at work.
What We Do in the Shadows,1,A fangtastic return to form.
Pachinko,1,"It’s a deeply rewarding, even exquisite work..."
WandaVision,1,The first major Marvel Studios project to release onto the new mega streaming service Disney+ fulfilled big expectations and then some.
Better Call Saul,1,"Could ""Better Call Saul"" have been a love story all along?"
The Wheel of Time,0,"Wheel of Time is a frustrating series that is intermittently compelling, but much of the time is dead boring, with one of the most memorably unmemorable group of characters Ive seen in a long time."
Forever,1,"[The show] sets the couple on an existential journey like no other, one that's still universal in how it poignantly and humorously confronts the big issues of life and love."
Game of Thrones,1,It was a fitting end to the story.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"The inevitable result, of course, is for each episode to feel like a carefully wrought and promising pitch for an ongoing series - just so many pilot episodes, elbowing each other for pickup."
The Mandalorian,1,"""This is the Way"" is a fitting catch phrase, because The Mandalorian really is the way Star Wars should excite you, surprise you, and keep you wanting more."
Big Little Lies,1,"Rather than running out of gas in its second season, Big Little Lies is more deliciously watchable than ever."
Devs,0,"Somewhere in Devs, there are relevant lessons to be learned about the misuse of technology and the age-old conflict between predestiny and free will... But this series is so hard to... decode that any of its deeper meanings get lost."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"Though it's questionable whether the circuitous journey makes the destination worthwhile, The Man in the High Castle nevertheless builds toward a fascinating finale."
God's Favorite Idiot,1,"As funny as McCarthy is, Falcone doesn’t seem to be able to resist the temptation to let her loose before anything about her character can even be established."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It's hard not to grab on to the confectionary delight of this show with both hands, rolling and reveling in the sincere joy it takes in the idea of the musical as both an art form and necessary emotional touchstone."
The Wonder Years,1,"The Wonder Years is a trip down memory lane, but it casts a fresh and welcome eye."
The Alienist,1,"While the dialogue at times gets hokey, there is an earnestness at work behind every performance, stitched into every costume and painted into each drab street sign."
Shadowhunters,1,Lilith's disciples could be the toughest enemies the group has had to fight yet.
1883,0,An opportunity to disrupt present-day comprehension of a transformative period in U.S. history is wasted on yet another narrative from the point of view of white settlers.
Mindhunter,1,"David Fincher takes a perverse, almost lusty thrill in exploring the minds of serial killers. It's incredibly nerdy fun."
The Alienist,1,"Every week it reveals just enough to keep us coming back, mixing gothic ambiance with bloody murder and shared feelings too dangerous to admit."
Twin Peaks,1,I love Twin Peaks because it represents David Lynch at his most gleefully ornery. The man can do whatever he likes. I'm in deep.
Landscapers,1,"Thewlis and Colman are amazing, whether they're quietly but passionately declaring their love for one another while under investigation or appearing as idealized versions of themselves in the fantasy sequences...."
Big Little Lies,1,"If you're looking for a rigorous, credible storyline, maybe Big Little Lies isn't for you. If, however, you are interested in watching six of the greatest actresses alive swing for the fences, get ready for a very enjoyable seven episodes."
Borgen,1,This chapter of Borgen lives up to its lofty reputation of excellence in dramatic television worldwide.
Starstruck,1,The Rose Matafeo-helmed rom-com returns with more delightful observations into the oft-criticized genre...
Counterpart,1,The table is set for a faster-paced but significantly deeper conspiracy tale in this season of Counterpart.
The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"Certainly should stand out, as much as anything for bringing back a proud African-American family that has two happy parents, on equal (or greater) financial standing with any animated family on Disney Plus."
Bodyguard,1,"Even when Bodyguard does get a bit over the top, that same British flair for understatement prevents it from feeling as ridiculous as it might in other hands."
What If...?,1,"Marvel's ""What If...?"" is entertaining and fun and an enjoyable remix of MCU origins, but it could stand to have some more unique storytelling."
Superman & Lois,1,"The premiere had everything I love about the show, including the stunning visuals, so it will be fun to watch where the series goes next."
Minx,1,A snappy workplace dramedy drenched in the sunny glare of early 1970s Southern California.
The White Lotus,1,Coolidge combines real pain with laugh-out-loud comedy.
Starstruck,1,"Season 2 of Starstruck takes the show from the novelty of the star-regular-person dynamic of the first season and concentrates on the chemistry of the ensemble, which is the sign of a maturing show."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Get Back is the noble kind of nostalgia project. It rises to the unenviable task of offering new insights into one of the most documented music careers of all time.
Big Little Lies,1,Its nuanced look at the ways that domestic violence can remain hidden from public view is one of the series' most important additions to the cultural conversation.
The Flight Attendant,1,"It’s funny, it’s dark, it’s intriguing, and it’s sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I could not recommend this show enough."
Psych,1,"The real triumph of Psych is that it has lasted eight seasons, since it hails from a TV genre of absurd and sometimes silly humor that often wears out its welcome quickly."
Big Little Lies,1,"Electric with snappy dialogue, visual splendor, and genuinely remarkable performances, Big Little Lies Season 2 is still the sensual, gripping high-camp that we all fell in love with, but a bit older and wiser."
Safe,0,"Skip it, unless you're a Hall or Coben completist. It just feels like the twists aren't going to be nearly as twisty as Coben thinks they're going to be."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The childhood/adulthood flashbacks are as good as This Is Us, the horror better than Hereditary, the whole thing better than the similar Castle Rock and Sharp Objects."
The Morning Show,1,"""The Morning Show"" most definitely succeeds at striking the balance between advancing its own personality-driven narrative and tackling topical issues in one entertaining drama."
Taboo,1,The glimpses of London low life in the opening episode are tougher and more squalid than Dickens -- and not a wholesome family watch: Poldark it ain't.
Star Wars Rebels,1,"As long as those endings are satisfying, as long as they honor all of the wonderful characters, Rebels' four-year journey will have been a successful one."
Big Little Lies,0,"Big Little Lies will never be without its pleasures. But this season, those pleasures feel divided."
Peaky Blinders,1,Peaky Blinders goes out in predictably thrilling fashion.
Normal People,1,"What sustains and elevates the show, even at its dullest, is the formidable artistry evident just beneath the surface."
True Detective,1,"The effect of racial stereotypes on the carriage of justice is also examined. In this way the show succeeds in categories that early seasons couldn't even compete in, and categorically improves its canon."
Twin Peaks,1,When watching everything just... fits.
Hannibal,1,The degree to which Hannibal is willing to withhold answers and meaning while still managing to present a thoroughly engrossing show from week-to-week is refreshing.
Loki,1,"In a different timeline, Loki would have made for an excellent Christopher Nolan movie. But in the timeline that you and I share, it's an exciting and genuinely inspired addition to Marvel storytelling."
The Good Place,1,"It's The Good Place at its best, using a moral dilemma to force its dysfunctional cast of characters to work together, and cutting what could be a saccharine moral with barbed jokes and startling twists."
Gaslit,1,"The rare show that has loads of fun bringing history into sharper focus. It takes the names you know, and may have read about, and shows why you should care."
Friday Night Lights,1,"Man, that was one fine, emotional, intelligent, and satisfying ending."
Squid Game,1,It's not the kind of apocalypse story that longs for hopeful human resilience; it's most eloquent on the topics of financial despondence and weaponized nostalgia.
Succession,1,"Again and again, Armstrong and his collaborators keep things fresh by reminding us that spinelessness is the defining characteristic for so many of its regulars."
30 Rock,1,"At the moment, network TV is relatively rich with farce... 30 Rock operates at several orders of magnitude higher."
Prison Break,0,"This show was junk food, and proud of it. That's what makes Prison Break's return as a nine-episode miniseries so baffling: Now, the show wants to mean something. And it's horrible."
Man vs. Bee,0,"While Atkinson’s performance is as commandingly skilful as you would expect, at times it is about as much fun as a boot stamping on a human face for ever, to borrow from George Orwell."
The Big Conn,1,"Conn’s wild antics, from his outlandish personal life to his ill-fated, “Catch Me If You Can” taunting of the FBI, are the stuff of feature films..."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The series also succeeds in making the cerebral game of chess come alive even for viewers who don't know a rook from a pawn.
Veep,1,"And yet, while it may not be quite as insightful or scathing as it once was, ""Veep"" is still one of the best shows on TV, largely because it has arguably the best ensemble, all of whom return at the top of their game."
Watchmen,1,"Visually entrancing, pointedly provocative and all over the place in time and space, Watchmen might make even David Lynch drop his jaw at times."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"This is the show's series finale, and probably its final farewell."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"It doesnt always hit, and when it does hit it doesnt even pack a particularly hard punch, but its a fun ride and gives in to an unhinged, artist-driven creativity that makes it feel novel."
The Leftovers,1,"In an era of TV tough guys, Kevin is fascinatingly atypical."
Monsters at Work,1,"The show doesn't deliver belly laughs, but it nimbly slides into the ""Monsters"" timeline and cleverly builds on a particularly fertile Pixar concept."
True Detective,1,These efforts pay off in a solid third season whose structure and style hew close to those of the first.
True Detective,1,"Three seasons in, it's clear what ""True Detective"" is: a platinum-cast anthology of moody crime stories in which familiar cops with familiar demons chase familiar devils."
Severance,1,"A tone-blending speculative series in which nearly every element is all too relatable, whether that makes it funny or sad or straight-up horrifying."
Foundation,1,Here's hoping Foundation finds its feet and its personality more in upcoming episodes.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia seems to have something interesting to say about female beauty standards and the suffocating constrictions of the patriarchy, but it gets jumbled among all the other things the show is trying to be."
The First,0,"You'd think a show about space exploration would be at least somewhat thrilling and wondrous, but The First makes going into space seem like a grim, depressing prospect."
The Expanse,1,The Expanse ends well in part because it doesn't try to provide a true ending to the conflicts it's explored for six seasons.
Raised by Wolves,1,"While the show's canvas has expanded, it hasn't lost its focus on the big questions of faith, identity, and family it's been wrestling with since the pilot."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag's back, and it's better than ever."
The Expanse,1,Expanse goes out in style with six episodes that tie up the ongoing plotline very well. It also heavily teases the next big plotline which is odd given it's the final season!
Girls,1,A welcome catch-up with infuriating old friends who'll be gone all too soon.
Defending Jacob,1,"A gripping, well-produced and directed, legal drama that will keep you guessing until the end. Chris Evans is great here, flexing his dramatic chops. [Full review in Spanish]"
Trying,1,"With smart, succinct, and creative writing, and comedy used in just the right proportions, Spall and Smith deliver a one of a kind show."
The Good Wife,1,"I doubt that this finale will be beloved, either, because it didn't reward the characters. But for me it was an ending that commanded respect."
The Sinner,1,"As played with brooding subtlety and an inscrutable squint by Pullman, Harry's psyche is often as disturbing as the mysteries he solves in this unsettling series."
Friday Night Lights,1,"The difference between Friday Night Lights and so many other humdrum, forgettable ""soft"" dramas is the strength of the writing, the believability of the actors and characters they play, and ultimately, how effectively it's all put together."
The Boys,1,"This season is chaotic, unhinged, and shocking. Antony Starr is on another level, as Homelander continues down his rage-filled path. The addition of Jenson Ackles as Soldier Boy is perfect, and this series continues to perfectly balance humor with action."
Sweet Tooth,1,"I'm enjoying the message of kindness and the incredible acting by the main character Gus, and Big Man (Nonso Anozie), I highly recommend this series which will be renewed for another season"
Man vs. Bee,1,You certainly need to be in the mood to laugh at slapstick in order to enjoy Man Vs. Bee. But there is no one on the planet who does slapstick better than Rowan Atkinson...
The Fall,1,"Mr. Cubitt's unconventional methods mix standard police thriller elements of detection and chase with long, quiet scenes of conversation, interrogation and surveillance."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"When they let the inherently big personalities shine through, and let these actors really act, I loved it."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"While I'm not particularly sold on the Bad Batch being ""truly"" bad, or even all that complicated, they do provide an off-kilter dynamic that may lead to some interesting developments down the line."
Euphoria,1,"Euphoria reminds us of the recklessness of being a teenager, the rootless, emotionally charged way you can live when there’s food in the fridge and no bills. What’s more euphoric than that?"
Stranger Things,1,A summer blockbuster in TV form.
Mare of Easttown,1,"The way Kate Winslet realizes Detective Mare Sheehan persuades you to stick with it past its glum first hour. If you manage to do this, the show just might grow on you."
Entourage,1,Entourage offers a reason for fans to be encouraged about the quality of its last episodes.
Moon Knight,1,"Isaac gives it his all, playing multiple characters, doing various accents, and bounding about all over the place like a human pinball."
Fleabag,1,It is warped yet affecting. It is filthy yet elegant. It is funny yet painful.
Parenthood,1,"It's been the most sincere program on television, often mocked for its many scenes ending in tears, but never relenting in its goal to present parenthood as a difficult yet ultimately rewarding adventure."
iCarly,1,"The combination of adult humor with the corniness and energy of these characters is not easy, yet iCarly nails it every time."
The Twilight Zone,1,"If the rest of Season 2 is as bold and original as its first three episodes, it's well on its path to eclipsing that uneven first season and potentially becoming a must-watch series of television."
Outer Range,0,"Brolin’s good and if the series eschewed the sci-fi conceit there’s enough good actors here to at least make it entertaining. But slathering a sci-fi element on top of it and not understanding what tone to strike doesn’t lead to oil, it leads to crap."
The Morning Show,1,"It's the inner politics of UBA that keep the season darkly intriguing and sharp... All in all, ""The Morning Show"" packs a slightly weaker punch this time around, but it still doesn't merit cancellation."
Dr. Brain,1,"Some folks may not find Dr. Brain to be as weird as they'd like it to be, but the overall series is still entertaining."
Friends,1,The old gang finally closes this chapter on their lives together. It's been fun...and real.
Amazing Stories,0,"The premiere episode has its virtues, starting with the solid promise and the romantic chemistry between the leads. Visually, however, it's not exactly dazzling."
The Outsider,1,"Although this adaptation is too well-heeled for its pulpy material, the show has a terrific plot hook, and once I made peace with its moody rhythms, I found myself hooked, devouring the six hours available for preview in two nights."
We Own This City,1,"If youre willing to risk watching a show made for adult consumption about pressing, complicated questions, however, you will feel rewarded. The show will remain with you long after your initial viewing in a way few shows do."
Breaking Bad,1,"It is a tremendous series, terrifically written and acted, with a black sense of humor unmatched by any other."
Reacher,1,"Reacher is a gritty, action packed series that captures the heart of the Jack Reacher series. Alan Ritchson is a great fit for the role, and I have to say that I do look forward to seeing more of him in future seasons."
The Mosquito Coast,1,Secrets are scattered across this bracing cinematic plunge into the odyssey of the Foxes. It's the next great TV show you should see.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"It means seeing a ferocious reptile rest at the surface and make derp face before it immediately starts to brawl with a younger male. This is peak entertainment, folks!"
The Wire,1,The Wire avoids caricatures with pitch-perfect depictions of the criminals scrapping their way to the top of a bloody heap.
Westworld,1,"It’s an absolute smorgasbord of thespian delights. Even at its most opaque, Westworld has always been worth watching just for those performances."
Acapulco,1,"Acapulco allows these tensions to rise naturally-never forcing a happy resolution, but also not belaboring the friction. It's a well-balanced show with an endearing lead performance and a whole roster of equally charming supporting players."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The result is a series with a slow burn that reaches electrifying moments and, ultimately, offers satisfying closure."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"It focuses too much on tiresome suburban ennui to be anything more than fleetingly interesting, despite excellent performances from Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Michael Mann, who directed the sensational pilot episode of this fact-based series about an American reporter (a terrific Ansel Elgort) covering the crime beat in Tokyo, shows you how thrilling action can be when a world-class talent is calling the shots"
Justified,1,Justified called it quits and went out with a finale that was as unpredictable and poetic and entertaining and memorable as the series itself. What a triumph.
Boardwalk Empire,1,Sorting out the sins and sinners in the final eight episodes of Boardwalk Empire promises to be as intriguing as it will be intense.
Normal People,1,"Normal People is terrific, absolutely gorgeous, up there with the best TV dramas of recent years."
Invincible,1,"Invincible is brutally violent, darkly comedic, and is one of the greatest animated superhero shows to be released. From beginning to its final moments Episode 1 sets the bar."
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr Corman straddles the line between drollness and ruminative drama, and is playfully experimental."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, Sex Lives shares the same sharp, smart, and sassy comedic sensibility as Never Have I Ever, while tackling a wider range of young-adult issues."
Watchmen,1,"A haunting end to Watchmen's season 1 debut. But, it does bring ""Running Out of Ice's"" chilling cold open full circle."
Love,1,"If Mickey and Gus don't remind you of passionate or frightening or warm moments in relationships you've had, you're a cold fish indeed."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Hiller is destined to become a stand out among the ensemble... This is almost sure to be the next big feel-good show (along with the delightfully quirky Abbott Elementary), though Somebody Somewhere is much more grounded than most of its predecessors."
Gravity Falls,1,"Gravity Falls treats its young viewers with respect, and with a lot of trust. It never gives the impression of tricking kids into seeing something they shouldn't... just tricking their parents into letting them see something they might not be allowed to."
Pachinko,1,The show finds boundless human complexity and different kinds of love beneath melodramatic cliches.
The First Lady,1,Its as if they are chapters on the many sacrifices and existential crises that occur to you when you are more defined by what happens for others than what happens to you.
Killing Eve,0,"We’re back in the same well-worn old saddle again, trotting around in the same tired old circles."
Coyote,0,"An unwanted bouquet of loose ends gradually reveals itself - quite possibly the result of the season order being truncated from 10 to six episodes after a COVID work stoppage, but unfortunate and distracting nonetheless."
Better Call Saul,1,"Six seasons in, Better Call Saul has grown into a climactic, character-driven drama whose greatness parallels that of Breaking Bad."
Ozark,1,"It can be seen as death of the American dream stuff. Mostly, it's just terrific drama. But yes, if you are looking for it, there is plenty said about the state the US is in."
Save Me,1,"The performances are all superb. James is extraordinary, a tour de force, while Suranne Jones, as Jody's anguished mother, is heartbreakingly believable."
Lovecraft Country,1,"In Lovecraft Country, Smollett is even more physical than she was when she was a superhero. And as is the case for Charlize Thereon, there's something about the 50s clothes and makeup that suits Smollett exceptionally well."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,The prolific Jackson provides a reminder of his range.
The White Lotus,1,"Across all six episodes, a convincing thesis emerges: The curse of the privileged is that they would rather be miserable than lose even a tiny fraction of the things they've been given."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The writing sometimes takes too long to truly get things going ... but thats when the collective charisma of its cast kicks in, as they are able to fill in a great deal of the shows gaps."
Godless,1,"Godless keeps its world as expansive as the vast plains, so beautifully shot on location in Santa Fe. The supporting cast s strong, but no one is more electric than the always extraordinary Merritt Wever."
The Gilded Age,1,"In many ways The Gilded Age is a series about the different ways of living, and of looking at the world, that can exist within a shared space."
Yellowjackets,1,"As creators, Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson put forth a solid cocktail of genres. [Full review in Spanish]"
Y: The Last Man,1,"It's the show you didn't know you needed - a post-apocalyptic drama populated almost exclusively with strong, competent, complex women."
Jersey Shore,1,"There is a kind of vacuous, ferocious materialism to the kids of Jersey Shore that makes it the most compelling of these shows. They seem to need all the empty hedonism more than others."
Rome,1,"This pretty much is a brutal soap opera for the ages, the bloodshed capricious and often jarring in its capacity to instill a sense of unease."
Tokyo Vice,1,Tokyo Vice is best appreciated as an in-depth look at how one of the world’s most fascinating cities operated at the turn of the century...
Sharp Objects,1,Amy Adams' Sharp Objects stands a good chance at becoming the show of the summer.
Night Sky,0,"The Night Sky is an undeniable misfire, but inside the slow first season is a gem of a story. I want to take the whole thing into Final Cut and chop it down to a short film."
Vikings,1,These episodes land with the fury of Thor's hammer.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Season two is a whole new Frank Castle adventure and all the better for it. From a solid beginning to one of the best homages to Assault on Precinct 13 made in quite some time, The Punisher is bringing a serious A-game to its latest go around the block."
Mad Men,1,"Here's a prediction about the final season: Peggy is the one to watch. Her journey is the one people are going to be blogging, tweeting and talking about."
Angelyne,0,"Angelyne approximates its subject in the wrong ways: It's big, attention-getting and has all the depth of a billboard."
True Detective,1,"Almost four years after the underwhelming second season, True Detective has returned-and it blessedly resembles the original season."
Earth to Ned,0,"If this was a regular network and the first shows landed with the thud that these do, there'd be panic and a mad hunt to recast."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It's a very affectionate, very specific parody of Golden Age musicals, and theater nerds will undoubtedly adore it... but others might be put off by all the excessive cheer. (The exclamation point in the title is there for a reason.)"
The Stand,1,The scattershot story didn't do a lot to pique my interest in what lies ahead.
The Afterparty,1,"In the hands of creator and director Christopher Miller, Apple TV+'s The Afterparty takes this versatility and runs with it, creating one of the most entertaining shows of the young new year."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Daredevil's third season does not simply pick up where the last one left off, but rather after the events of the mashup miniseries The Defenders."
Search Party,1,"What's surprisingly undeniable, however, is how satisfying a conclusion this is to the larger journey Search Party's been on this entire time."
Rick and Morty,1,"If not the biggest or most daring season premiere the series has delivered, ""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is nonetheless an enjoyable start to the new season."
Taboo,1,"What's most satisfying about this fine-tissued narrative is the way it keeps shifting, the way it takes on the excitements of, say, an Alexandre Dumas novel without quite ever going pell-mell for breathless derring do."
Ramy,1,"If in its first season, Ramy ... was a breath of fresh air (merely by focusing on an American-born Muslim), then the second season is a display of the series' empathetic depth."
Watchmen,1,"[It] unfolds in the way a giant jigsaw puzzle gets put together, with isolated fragments of the bigger picture being revealed bit by bit. It's a genuinely thrilling thing to witness as the series progresses."
Bel-Air,1,"Despite the more serious tone, the show still has heart."
The Good Wife,0,"The main thing is that we've finally put this show out of its misery, so it can't stray any further from the brilliant, decisive characters it originated. And hey. That's better than nothing."
Gaslit,1,"My new obsession is this vivid recreation of the 1970s Watergate era, when all eyes turned to Washington, D.C. for the biggest TV show of its day: the nationally televised Watergate hearings."
Brave New World,1,"As pure entertainment ""Brave New World"" is well-paced and features a strong cast... We are just left wondering what the show wants to say or cares about."
WandaVision,1,"Quirky, humorous and with fascinating characters, I'm interested to see what kind of long, strange trip Wanda and Vision have planned."
Yellowjackets,1,"While the pulpy show is an addicting psychological thriller, the ultimate lifeline that makes it standout from other survival series is that it's really about the humanity of these women, and to the degrees in which it's tainted."
Westworld,0,"While there is surely intelligent life out there eager to see where this goes, at this point it's not so much a question of not being able to follow the series through its convoluted maze as simply not feeling as if it's worth the energy to try."
This Way Up,1,"It's short, sweet, but worth every bit of your time."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"The noirish feel of old Hollywood fits the show perfectly, and between the developing mystery and deepening relationships, this season is off to a great start."
The Wheel of Time,1,"All told, The Wheel of Time has way more to woo book readers than repel them."
The Wire,0,Simon so forces events in the improbable newspaper story line of an invented serial killer that he does serious damage to the credibility of the police drama.
Schmigadoon!,0,"Nice cast and all, but Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio's strained and stilted offering spends most of its time threading a rickety line between half-baked parody and annoyingly clunky Rodgers and Hammerstein tribute."
1883,1,"It's enough to say that 1883 is everything you've come to expect from Taylor Sheridan, who's playing a greatest hits compilation of arch macho melodrama on the Oregon Trail, and some of the characters have the surname Dutton."
Fargo,1,"Incredibly ambitious, at times outrageously inventive and breathtaking, Noah Hawley's Coen Brothers-inspired anthology series is back with a bang."
Lovecraft Country,1,Showrunner Misha Green knows how to find the joy in the moment - or in the pages of a good pulp novel - without denying the historical context.
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll's second season finds a way to keep the feistiness of time trickery alive with a Quantum Leap-style story that, of course, leads to wonderfully tender and meaningful catharsis."
Scandal,1,"Well, we didn't see any of that coming. Although, we probably should have."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye is a phenomenal entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the perfect showcase for Jeremy Renner to finally give us the full Clint Barton experience, aided by a show-stopping performance from Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop."
The First Lady,0,Each episode wastes the firepower in front of the camera by plugging its actors into flashpoints and watershed moments as opposed to filling in the open canvas with cues and hints about who they are during the quieter moments.
24,1,"Our hero returns! And there is no stopping him. He just beats everyone up. Boom, boom, shaka laka, boom!"
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Just as bloody, gore-filled, and vulgar as the live action show, it allows for a new way to see the world of our favorite Supes."
After Life,0,"Its themes have become repetitive to the point where ""Life"" has clearly run its course."
The Baby,1,"The Baby is a dark comedy with the emphasis on the dark part, but as the secrets of this creepy baby are revealed, the show should become more interesting to watch."
Sex and the City,1,"Carrie Bradshaw is no Tony Soprano, but she gives you a reason to keep paying that HBO freight."
Under the Dome,0,"If there was a destination or a point in mind, it's well past the point of mattering now."
Roar,1,Roar tells uncanny tales about our modern world that lay bare the absurdity of the stigmas and obstacles that women encounter in everyday life. It is also a daring foray into the surreal.
The Nevers,1,"You don't need Amalia's gift of foresight to see how transformative this could be, transcending Whedon's tired formula to create something bolder and more current, something less derivative of the many stories like this that have come before."
Normal People,1,"By keeping the camera tight, director Lenny Abrahamson allows us to see every emotion, perfectly capturing the intensity of youthful love."
Mindhunter,1,"Thankfully, season 2 delivers more structure and story across nine episodes, more deeply acquainting us with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit."
Invincible,1,This lurid animated series combines the levity of a classic coming-of-age comedy with the trend of increasingly gritty superhero dramas.
Midnight Mass,1,A confident tale of slow-building supernatural horror
The Expanse,1,"An intense season with high stakes that will have everyone on the edge of their seats. Character arcs are completed well, but with just six episodes it feels rushed."
The Boys,1,The Boys Season Three gives us yet another crucial representation of current American society and its struggle to become whole amidst all of the blatant untruths and bigotry that has permeated it since its origin.
The First,1,"Even with a thruster rocket full of inspirational motivations and overly meticulous visuals, The First really doesn't have anything new to say, up close or in the big picture."
Pachinko,1,"This Apple TV+ show is, like the 490-page book, epic in its scale -- and enrapturing in its execution."
WandaVision,1,It's rare to encounter a TV show that remains enjoyable in spite of how little information it gives the audience.
Friends,1,Friends presented a unique balance between making us laugh and giving us reasons to cry.
Chucky,1,"It's scary, it's funny, it's a little campy. We have this new fresh middle school setting and we're telling this new story while also still [...] learning more about this history and legacy of this entire franchise."
Mare of Easttown,1,"For all its unevenness, Mare of Easttown's strengths carry it through its many muddles."
The Undoing,1,"The first episode really is terrific, just less so than Big Little Lies. Still, it's worth seeing for the Kidman-Grant acting duel and Donald Sutherland as Kidman's infinitely arrogant and judgmental father."
Sweet Tooth,1,The series perfectly demonstrates how to tell several parallel stories and at the same time build a mythology around a cataclysmic event. [Full review in Spanish]
Stranger Things,1,"The '80s horror influences inspired the Duffer brothers to make a tonal shift from the prior seasons, easily making Stranger Things 4 the darkest and longest — and possibly most entertaining — entry yet."
Counterpart,1,The acting - especially that of JK Simmons' two versions of Howard Silk - is once again outstanding.
Normal People,1,"Normal People is beautifully acted, atmospheric and sharply detailed. Six whole hours, though, feels like a stretch."
Legion,1,"The loopy digressions are as vivid as ever... But there's also solid character development, inventive depictions of mutant powers, a delightful bit of mime from Bill Irwin and at least one genuine narrative surprise."
BoJack Horseman,1,The entire creative team is just running on all cylinders this season and all of the classic scathing critiques of modern society are ample and impactful.
Watchmen,1,"Lindelof's work will either add up to the coolest, most intricate dramatic series this side of Westworld or the biggest swing-and-a-miss in recent television history."
Girls,1,"If you're Girls, you don't give in to reflection and coasting on the loyalty of your audience. You keep running, you don't flinch and you don't slow down."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"It is the chemistry between the two leads, who are old friends from New Zealand, that keeps this lark afloat."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"This is not only a highly engaging action-adventure series about who will be the next Captain America superhero, it also offers an informed discussion about symbolism, race, American history, heroism and image."
Counterpart,1,[Nazanin] Boniadi's acting capabilities have been put on display in a way that should have heads turning and people talking in a big way... Counterpart is creating some of the most interesting and intriguing roles for women.
The Crown,1,"Eminently watchable, eternally classy, and enormously well performed, S4 sparkles and other points exasperates, but in that sense reflects the tenor of the era it covers."
The Undoing,0,"Not even Kidman's performance, nor sharp turns from the likes of Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland, can quite center its diffuse interests."
Monk,1,There are many fabulous stand-alone episodes in season eight.
Waco,1,It's probably the best account we will ever have of what happened on April 19th and the 51 days leading up to it.
What If...?,1,"While an episode like this can never be replicated due to the loss of Boseman, it still shows how What If...? can continue to elevate familiar Marvel characters by making good on the series' limitless potential."
Calls,1,"The nightmares in our heads are scarier than any monster conjured up on screen. For the mind is susceptible to suggestion and ripe for manipulation. If only the stories were more fresh, Calls could have been a fine advertisement for audio storytelling."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"""The Clone Wars"" kicked off its last season with a war-filled episode that will certainly have fans talking... But the episode tells all ""Star Wars"" fans that it's time to unite one more time and get through the ongoing battle together."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"These kids win my heart and make me guffaw. Please, BBC/Netflix, don't make a third season. I want to walk away and always remember Alyssa and James in their awful, tentative, f***ed-up glory."
30 Coins,1,"30 COINS is exciting, with its twists and turns keeping the viewer guessing until the very end."
Brave New World,1,"Whether by showrunner David Weiner's design or network notes, the show lightens up, allowing for more moments of dark humor but also some weird character turns."
Taboo,1,"It is filled with darkness, danger and mystery, and has a level of quality and import not often seen in television miniseries."
Deadwood,0,"Deadwood is a terribly, terribly hard show to love. But apparently there are some people who still do."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things, no longer just a show about monsters or the retro novelty of cassette Walkmans, is exploring within its highly stylised parameters what its audiences really care about: the depths of the self and the complexities of human experience."
Earth to Ned,1,"It's the strangest thing on Disney+ by a considerable margin and that's a good thing -- Earth to Ned has a personality and flavor all its own. You'll be begging to be beamed up, again and again."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is Marvel's first new offering since Martin Scorsese compared Marvel movies to theme parks and complained they didn't constitute ""cinema"", and the new Marvel series seems like a direct response to those remarks."
The Staircase,0,"In The Staircase Mark Two, highly complex events are revealed in flashbacks so numerous that no momentum is ever able to build. Just as a scene starts getting interesting, we're whipped back to a different year altogether."
Psych,1,"I reckon everyone who watched ""Lock, Stock"" had [a] smashing time anyway."
The Americans,1,"Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are better here than ever before, and a real asset in a show that's long been dedicated to the art of showing, and not telling, when it comes to the emotional evolution of its characters."
Chucky,0,"These script ""gimmicks"" feel insufficient to re-launch a product that is perceived as exhausted. [Full review in Spanish]"
Marvel's Daredevil,0,"Despite marquee villains new and old, the Man Without Fear thus risks becoming the Series That Induces Sleep."
Big Little Lies,1,"If the show isn't the singular masterpiece of the first season, that's because that season was truly meant to be singular. But coming close to meeting a bar set that high is still worth toasting with a glass of champagne over a gorgeous fire pit."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's atmospheric, with a nearly consistent undertone of dread, peppered with just the right amount of jump scares to spice things. Yet, at its heart, The Haunting of Hill House is much more than a ghost story."
Losing Alice,1,"The echoes here include Fatal Attraction and even The Player, but focusing the power dynamic on two women gives the building menace a fresh perspective."
The Outsider,1,"Every character finds themselves up against something they cannot comprehend, something that normal life cannot explain. That's an exciting angle to take a crime drama, as the question of why is as pertinent as the question of how."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"In Season 4, the crew of Discovery is united, whole, and providing comfort and hope both to each other, and to a world that needs that right now. Maybe that's the most radical reinvention of all."
The OA,1,There are moments in Part II that are so visually and conceptually bold... There are other moments that skirt so close to the pretentious and ridiculous that they made me think I might actually transform into the eye-roll emoji.
Friends,0,"The show never rose above its artificial, formulaic roots - characters assembled straight from the sitcom-writer's handbook, jokes delivered with mechanical predictability at the network-mandated rate of three per page."
The Mandalorian,1,Dhat Dave Filoni and John Favreau have done with this series... gives new life to the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
Pieces of Her,0,Not exactly a page turner.
Atlanta,1,"For the third and penultimate season of Atlanta, everyone returns to characters they know well for a brilliant season that upends expectations beyond what we already have come to associate with this series."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"A heartbreakingly funny story, delivering pathos and discomfort as only brilliant comedic performers can."
The Office,1,"It is not quite the same show as the one that debuted in March 2005, but it has continued to be a show I watch, grumbling occasionally, with great and in many respects increasing pleasure."
Black Mirror,1,The present day-with-a-twist anthology series works best when it avoids easy moralising and keeps us in a spin.
Archer,0,"Maybe that emphasis on putting a new shine on old fruit is fitting, since this does, indeed, feel just like an episode of Archer-only older."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,This series does a fantastic job of connecting the MCU to an intriguing new plot line designed especially for television.
Barry,1,"It has always been a good show, but in its third season, Barry is beyond good...in turns hilarious and tragic. In an era where there is so much good television, there isn’t anything else quite like Barry."
Peacemaker,1,Peacemaker is a unique gem within the outlook of boring superheroes and exploited ad nauseam franchises.
Outer Range,1,Outer Range should be one of the most discussed series in the coming weeks. [Full review in Spanish]
Big Little Lies,1,"...still snappy, but it's missing a bit of desperate, secretive anger that made Season 1 so addicting."
Little America,1,"Every episode boasts different writers, directors, actors, and DPs - all of whom produce peerless work, all of whom bring a sense of authenticity to the culture being explored, all of whom I need to see work more and more in 2020 and beyond."
Watchmen,1,"It's the visionary production details that work so, so well."
Devs,0,"The series's synthesis of aesthetic, plot, and subtext slowly starts to pull apart in its exposition-heavy second half."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"Perhaps foremost, ""1971"" reflects how music influenced the national agenda during that period, as exemplified by songs like John Lennon's ""Imagine"" and Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Just say ""goodbye"" and leave the ""good riddance"" to Sheen."
Dave,1,"Painful and privileged, but clever."
The Twilight Zone,0,"[If] these episodes are to be taken as an indicator of the whole, The Twilight Zone season 2 is not worth a visit. [...] While we keep hoping for a brighter future for The Twilight Zone, it seems to be stuck in the past."
The Sopranos,1,"Chase isn't the only auteur to turn an audience's bloodlust against itself, but unlike, say, Michael Haneke or Quentin Tarantino, he chose an unnervingly quiet way to leave us on the hook, in perpetuity."
Steven Universe,1,Steven Universe is distinctive for its prominence of queerness and its relevance to narrative arcs. Queerness is not sidelined. It is at the forefront.
The O.C.,1,"The series did an excellent job of bringing back the strong early interaction between the main cast, and most importantly, the overall sense of fun that had been missing for so much of the previous year."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The main critique for We Are Lady Parts remains that it is too short. I want eight episodes, or 10, or 50."
Evil,1,"Ever the capable procedural, Evil has finally found the sweet spot of how to layer in its serialized touches and glimpses of past run-ins."
Bridgerton,1,"With a second season that's more clever, moving, and emotionally complex than the first, this period drama proves that it's not just a titillating trifle."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"For now, it seems too content to wallow in a world of awful people doing awful things. And these first two episodes erect walls of toxicity from which the rest of the season could have a tough time escaping."
Limitless,0,The writers trade preposterous for convenient.
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Educational and entertaining in equal measure, The Mosquito Coast rattles its sabre at contemporary issues, whilst delivering a supremely polished piece of mainstream entertainment."
Rome,1,This is Horrible Histories for grownups.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Electrifying.
They Call Me Magic,1,Attractive yet conventional. [Full review in Spanish]
Ramy,1,"One of the many strengths... is how its star and creator widens the focus beyond its eponymous character's own journey to reveal the challenges of assimilation for the rest of his family, each of whom takes center stage in impactful episodes of their own."
Cardinal,1,"Cardinal provides that rare pleasure: a sense of something being better than it needs to be. It is slow without being frustrating or dull, thoughtful without being ponderous or pretentious."
Chappelle's Show,1,"The sketches here are high-grade Chappelle: funny and surprising, if not a full-on riot, as his best work on the show has been. But they also tell the story of an intellectual with an esoteric imagination."
Loki,1,"Because Loki is the most fun MCU character, the potential here is Marvel-ous. Lotsa complex exposition at the top but the potential for comic-licous atmosphere is apparent."
The Outsider,1,"Quite whether it needed to be this bloody slow, or all the jails and strip joints and forests in Georgia seemingly filmed through that same cowl, is up for debate. For all that, if you allow this to grab, it will."
Atlanta,1,"Hip-hop is a passion, but on ‘Atlanta’ and in Atlanta, it’s also a job. Donald Glover’s series makes sure to never forget that."
Fleabag,1,"If the first season was about honestly coming to terms with the damage sex can do, season two is about accepting what comes after confession, about the hard work of loving, even knowing the damage that love has brought and will bring again."
Mr. Corman,0,"Aside from a glimmer of invention when his world briefly becomes animated, there is nothing to hold your attention."
Catastrophe,1,Another deft mix of funny and serious from Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The film's accumulation of quirks and delights and boredom and exhilaration becomes more than fascinating; it becomes addictive.
Justified,1,"The greatest compliment I can pay Justified is to say that, despite the fact that it arrived at the height of the anti-hero boom, it never felt like a copycat. The drama created a vibrant, funny, tragic world of its own."
Community,1,"Good show, Yahoo."
The Act,1,"The tension is palpable in every scene, and this tension is supported by two career-best performances from Patricia Arquette and Joey King."
And Just Like That...,0,"As the show just-like-that shifts gears into a more somber and contemplative tone, I kept being reminded of a trenchant passage from Sondheim's Follies, when a jaded character sings, ""How do you wipe tears away/When your eyes are dry?"""
Inventing Anna,1,"If youre looking for an in-depth analytical exploration into her behaviour, this wont be the Netflix drama for you. If youre looking for a Real Housewives meet Gossip Girl drama about scamming the snobby wealthy of New York, youre in for a treat."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,A solid coming-of-ager wrapped in a not-so-good romance.
And Just Like That...,1,"It pulls the rug from under you, entirely, so I have to give it credit for that."
Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" has been reinvented as something more accessible, more vibrant, more action-driven, sexier, and yes, more fun in the traditional sense of the word."
True Detective,0,"It's clear that Pizzolotto still thinks like a novelist... His show struggles to find its sweet spot as a work of television, maybe because it's conceived with a pace and style that is better suited to the page."
True Detective,1,"I remember having reservations about another True Detective season and those fears only being eased slightly when Ali was announced to star. If you shared my fears, please believe that Ali's arrival was a very good sign."
Watchmen,1,Damon Lindelof manages to make fit all the relevant pieces creating a work that gives us the feeling of completeness. [Full review in Spanish]
The First Lady,0,"A show that feels too consistently shallow, hitting highlights from the lives of its subjects instead of revealing how one incident impacted another or how these people grew or changed once they were in the public eye."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is the the scariest MCU project to date, and the closest the franchise has come to outright horror."
Euphoria,0,Perhaps it's fitting: what could be more high-school than a sophomore slump?
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac acts his asp off as Marvel's ""Moon Knight,"" yet the action-challenged series still sputters."
The Flight Attendant,1,I’m here to watch the ship go down in flames with popcorn and a Cassie-approved soda with lime.
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education's third season is, frankly, great, with strong writing, direction, and performances. It's a must see."
The First,1,"The First is surprisingly pompous, inflated by its soundtrack... But stick with it."
Monsters at Work,1,"The new-and-improved Monsters, Inc. company's slogan is ""It's laughter we're after,"" and this joyful series follows through on the fictional company's goal."
Heartstopper,1,"I'm so grateful that Heartstopper exists. Because if you can't see yourself in the world around you, it's hard to see a future for yourself too. And no one should ever be made to feel like that."
11.22.63,1,"Despite its flaws, 11.22.63 ends up closing the deal in a way that for the most part makes it a long, strange time travel worth taking."
A Very English Scandal,1,"As it is, because the true events it so deftly depicts are largely unknown to American audiences, the three-part A Very English Scandal will make for very satisfying mini-binge on Friday night or this weekend."
Big Little Lies,0,A melodrama that didn't have the courage to go the full camp; that puttered and faltered and finally fell over the Californian cliffs and into the sea.
Watchmen,1,Fans of the original comic will wait fascinated for the development of the story. Those who are discovering Watchmen for the first time will have to wait for additional clues to figure out the puzzle built by Lindelof. [Full Review in Spanish]
House,1,The sudden introduction of suicidal thoughts could easily play as soapy...But House has always been a character with one foot in the self-inflicted grave.
Catastrophe,1,Season four feels like the right time for the show to end.
Ginny & Georgia,0,Ginny & Georgia isn't the new 'Gilmore Girls.' It's a mess...
Black Mirror,1,There was little novelty that we have come to expect from this show. Let's hope Charlie Brooker's devilish mind has something more impressive for the show's future.
The Witcher,1,The season presents a strong sophomore entry for the existing fans of the show. [...But] the world is no easier to step back into and a Season One rewatch is essential...
Battlestar Galactica,1,"With a renewed sense of purpose and enthusiasm season four is more cohesive and creatively invigorating than the third installment of the series, which often felt disjointed and needlessly didactic."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"The crime-solving trio of Martin, Short, and Gomez shine in a second, suspenseful season of 'Only Murders in the Building.'"
Rise,0,"Rise is well-written, hopeful, and considerably more mild than Spring Awakening (this is network TV, after all), but it's still overly sexualized."
Rutherford Falls,1,"A sweeter, steadier sophomore outing."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Winning Time is so captivated with its own style that it misapprehends what made its subject exciting in the first place.
The Leftovers,1,"No matter how you feel about the actual subject matter, the performances and teleplays were transcendent."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Vincent D'Onofrio continues to give a rich, powerful, and intense performance as Fisk. Many say that he is one of the best comic book villains in the MCU and I would argue he's one of the best in the superhero genre."
Hellbound,1,"Terrific imagination, insight, characters and performances make for captivating viewing."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House contains some of the most unforgettable horror imagery in film or television in years.
Breaking Bad,0,"I can't shake the sense that ""Felina"" as a finale, and Breaking Bad as a whole, would have been more satisfying if it had been less satisfying."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"If four proves to be a qualitative anomaly, and if the fifth season of Boardwalk plays out more or less like the first three I'll be satisfied. I know what the show is at this point, and I've quit expecting it to be anything else."
The Afterparty,1,...The Afterparty is one of the best new comedy series to arrive this year.
BoJack Horseman,1,"I'll especially miss the voice of BoJack, Will Arnett. Going beyond his Batman growl and 30 Rock simper, Arnett eloquently expressed a horse's existential woes."
Fargo,1,"If you've stuck with ""Fargo"" this long and over the years haven't been turned away by the freewheeling nature of its story or the quirky characters which inhabit the narrative, than season 4 will prove just as rewarding."
Twin Peaks,1,As wayyy out there as Twin Peaks can get -- and it zoomed even farther beyond the outer limits than I thought it would this season -- watching it can still be remarkably personal.
Turner & Hooch,1,"Nothing feels dumbed down or muted, though the dog dilemma involving Hooch being thrust upon an unwilling owner feels like a questionable situation now instead of a light-hearted romp."
All of Us Are Dead,0,This is a show for teenagers (despite some rather shocking language) so there's not much for us O.G. horror fans to enjoy.
Altered Carbon,1,"At first it was hard to see where this season was going, and it seemed a bit less interesting than season 1. But ultimately, by the time you reach the end, it's hard not to be satisfied with the journey and the finale."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Albeit the second (and most likely final) season of The End of the F***ing World isn't as impactful or satisfying as its daring predecessor, it's a harmless epilogue that sketches a creamy outcome for these perturbed characters."
The Wilds,1,"Ultimately, “The Wilds” Season 2 is an intense but enjoyable watch that feels crowded at times with 8 new characters."
And Just Like That...,1,"I'll keep watching because I adore these characters, but some of the magic of what makes these characters great is missing for me."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"As it proved through its initial run, Only Murders in the Building is a witty, engrossing, thoroughly entertaining triumph whose delights are in the details and character interactions."
Succession,1,"Maybe it's churlish to complain about a series that's still consistently better written and more refreshingly caustic than anything else on TV. But for me, Season Three reveals some wear in a concept that once felt rousingly original."
11.22.63,1,"11.22.63 is sometimes a bumpy ride, but the destination is ultimately worth the journey."
The Good Wife,1,The show regained some sense of purpose once it was clear that this season would be its last and the Kings could start writing in earnest towards their planned ending.
The Mist,0,"The show is certainly trying its damnedest to present the dark underbelly of a beautiful town a la Twin Peaks, but the predictable characters don't make it feel like anything new."
Ozark,1,"As longtime fans know, a viewer is required to suspend a lot of his or her disbelief to enjoy Ozark to its fullest. That won't change now, as swallowing even that the Byrdes are still alive at this point will take some effort on your part."
The Offer,0,"With disconnected subplots, tensionless drama, and empty Easter Eggs galore, The Offer tries to weave a fictitious story about how The Godfather was made, while also trying (and failing) to match the movies stature as a sprawling gangster saga."
Unbelievable,1,"[A]bout 10 hours after I had started watching, I found myself finishing episode eight, completely overwhelmed by the humanity, intelligence and warmth of this brilliant show."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"D'Onofrio puts in another superb turn as the Kingpin, and he's so intensely watchable that Fisk makes up for much of the shortcomings of Daredevil season 3 early on."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Whatever happens in the episodes to come, at its heart Mare of Easttown is the story of a fierce, ordinary heroine, beautifully played. No fright wigs, no prosthetics. No need."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,A rare TV show that really delves into the multifaceted and endlessly entertaining world of undergraduate shenanigans.
Mr. Corman,1,Mr. Corman is a smartly experimental dramedy about the absurdity of life. Joseph Gordon Levitt should be applauded for trying to break TV boundaries and create a new narrative around mental health.
Amazing Stories,1,"For now, I will remain cautiously optimistic that Steven Spielberg didn't attach his name to this show without checking the quality of the material, but you never know."
WandaVision,1,"There are enough precarious moments in each ""WandaVision"" episode that make it clear the show might not work at all, in fact, without a nuanced actor like Olsen tethering it to some kind of reality."
The Defiant Ones,1,The Defiant Ones does spend a little too much time praising and mythologizing its subjects. But it's also a comprehensive look at Dre's and Iovine's history.
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Our Flag Means Death won’t be the deepest show you’ve seen about a midlife crisis, or the most dramatic — but should you find yourself in the mood to relax on mostly warm, mostly gentle waters with an adorable group of weirdos, it’ll hit the spot."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is entertaining enough, and features great performances, specifically from McCarthy and Hall, but the question of what Masha is exactly up to is never compelling enough to make the series a must watch."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"When an insufferable man is putting his family in danger and spouting philosophy, it's hard to care about his adventures on the run."
Normal People,1,"Take away all the dynamic storytelling and so-real-it-hurts humanity, and you're still left with a steamy quarantine binge that'll leave your heart racing in the best way."
Invasion,0,"The series is determined to tell, not show-relying on shots of people fleeing in terror or gaping at something offscreen, and waiting until the midseason mark to provide the first glimpse at what has everyone on the run."
The Nevers,1,"The show is coming into focus as something more ambitious and challenging than it originally appeared to be, and certainly something more unpackable and discussable."
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace can be as light-hearted and pleasant a story as it is a probing, surreal and melodramatic character study."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,Wonderland stands on its own as a new and thrilling fantasy world to explore.
Teen Wolf,1,"Teen Wolf has earned the right to play with some daring stories and tricky emotions, and it does just that in an assured, streamlined final season."
The Gilded Age,0,I truly can't bring myself to care about these people and their airless drawing-room lives.
Lovecraft Country,1,"While at times the effects are laughable and the sequences corny, the strong cast sells what is happening well enough to look past these occasional downfalls. Smollett and Majors, in particular, shine in every scene."
Ozark,1,"Ozark, however, never loses sight of the fact that selling your soul is rarely done solely for righteous reasons."
Twin Peaks,1,What a good show this is. Who cares who killed who?
Joe vs Carole,0,"Despite some clever writing and decent performances, Joe Vs. Carole can’t really add to the craziness that the real-life Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin showed in Tiger King and all of its offshoots."
Rise,1,"In a sense, the show itself is a rumination on whether a song would be enough to bridge any number of American divides. Part of the appeal of Rise is that it sure would be nice to think so."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,...the interconnectivity of these Star Wars shows continues to prove that the Disney approach to this wonderfully varied property is to make it all feel the same.
Station Eleven,1,"Powerful, elegiac, and entirely too realistic for those living through the COVID-19 pandemic, this series has profound things to say about life, loss, and the human spirit: if you can bear to watch."
A Teacher,1,"A Teacher doesn't try to spare its audience when it comes to how its core relationship develops; its banal portrait of a predator and the affair she creates does a good job accomplishing it's goal, which is to make its audience squirm."
Search Party,1,"Somehow, despite the bizarre last-minute transformation, the show still ends on a resounding high note."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"This may be one of Marvel's strongest seasons to date, but the Defenders franchise needs to shake off the formula and move onto something fresh."
Borgen,1,"Ultimately, the primary focus of Borgen remains its leading ladies and the series is wise to keep both Sidse Babett Knudsen and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen front and centre and grounding the show in their performances."
Deadwood,1,"The rich, complex language of this serialised western demands attention. Almost every character has a foul mouth but the expletives that pepper the dialogue somehow intensify the moments of beauty and wisdom."
The OA,1,"[The OA] manages to be stranger, more puzzling and even more addictively demented than the first season."
The Right Stuff,0,"The astronauts have little grain or complexity, beyond one or two single traits; they're network-deep portrayals -- at least those who register."
Star Wars Rebels,1,"Star Wars Rebels just gets back to brass tacks, pushing much of the show's arcs to the side to focus on one: Sabine, the Mandalorians, and the vague but powerful weapon she helped create."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"These shows masterfully combine the outsized and the subdued, contrasting broad, loud, propulsive comedy with surprisingly nuanced characterizations and a believable setting."
Archive 81,0,Frequently... audiences will likely be left cold and a little bored by a series that finds little to say amidst its endless ante-upping.
Sweet Tooth,1,"The inaugural season only chronicles part of Gus and Jepperd's journey, but what a mark it leaves. This adaptation slowly worms its way into your heart and threatens to rip it out through awe, wonder, and character-driven emotional depth."
Raised by Wolves,1,"Raised By Wolves season two starts out with a whole lot of stuff going on, but it already feels like a far more balanced season than the first."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Oleson and Co. have crafted such a dense, dark set-up here that, for the first time since Jessica Jones' first season, diving back into the streets of Hell's Kitchen feels more like a treat than a chore. Thank God."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Howey and Gentry are great both together and separately, the show's twisting plots are addictive and soapy without being too implausible, and there's a thoughtfulness in its approach to issues of race, sexuality and parenting. I kinda loved it."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The Beatles: Get Back series helps shift our understanding of who The Beatles were.
Atlanta,1,"Atlanta still boasts the best core quartet currently on television. It's still the best among at almost everything it does, in fact, including sliding onto Glover's always busy resume."
The Twilight Zone,0,"The second season of the science-fiction anthology series continues to suffer from what I call the John Carter Jinx - an affliction that affects properties that have inspired countless imitators, but in the process been overtaken by them."
11.22.63,1,The James Franco starrer is a very entertaining set of 8-episodes that tells a complete and interesting narrative. It's not particularly deep - you won't find yourself questioning any of life's big questions by its end - but it's a very enjoyable watch.
Six Feet Under,1,"Ball does such a good job of providing closure, and leaving characters and viewers with a memorable last chapter, that ""Six Feet Under"" instantly claims third place on the list of most memorable series finales."
Arrested Development,0,"The elements that used to work so well for Arrested Development, the characters, the narration, the off-the-wall locations and concepts, now all clash rather than working together."
Undone,1,"Deeply rich and resonant, as intelligent and affecting as sci-fi and animation alike get, and dedicated to thinking and feeling big while confronting everyday truths, Undone is like nothing else that's streaming."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Marvel's efforts to improve upon a poor start are appreciated, but Iron Fist season 2 doesn't do enough to bring Danny Rand out of his hotbed with mediocrity."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is naturally an important show for queer teens, but the reason why even parents of straight teens should watch the show together is that it depicts just how harmful homophobia is, without it getting too dark."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"As engaging a series as Attenborough has ever fronted, and one that's frequently astonishing."
Taboo,1,"How you feel about Taboo probably depends on how gothic you like your historical dramas to be. Personally I'm a fan of period pieces stuffed full of doom, gloom and melodrama and served with side dishes of long-stewing revenge and simmering violence."
Black Mirror,1,"Even with only three new episodes to watch, season 5 of Black Mirror delivers. All three episodes are worth watching - some more than once!"
Breaking Bad,1,"If this last hour or so was a little too perfect for its own good, then that's because it left (almost) no loose end untied"
Looking for Alaska,1,"The story should also be universal to anyone who has ever had a teenage experience and to anyone who has longed for something more, especially given your circumstances in life."
Chernobyl,1,The finale is the show's crowning achievement.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"You have a show of very handsomely designed interiors - museums, galleries, Masonic temples and whatnot - and then actors squinting and explaining. No matter how outlandish the topic of the discussions, there isn't enough oxygen in the room to sustain."
What If...?,1,"Being that it's an animated series, it certainly plays into having a younger audience as its demographic. There's more humor and the storytelling is a bit more simple and wrapped up in a quick fashion."
The Stand,1,"The first episode of the series shows potential, but chooses a not so easy to follow way of telling the story. It may alienate those not familiar with Stephen King's work."
Dr. Death,1,"With an ending that anyone could easily Google, Dr. Death still manages to keep you engaged to find out if Duntsch gets what is coming to him."
The Good Wife,1,One of the great things about the finale is that it ends smack in the middle of everything.
Hawkeye,1,"Renner and Steinfeld have great chemistry together, and their odd couple/buddy cop routine is delightful even when they're not embroiled in action sequences."
Russian Doll,1,"I mean -- you could try and watch it in instalments, but the lure of binge-watching in a single session is just way too powerful to resist."
Big Little Lies,0,"As the fans thirst for a THIRD season of this show, I beg them (and the powers that be at HBO) to please let it end. One season was amazing, two seasons was questionable, a third would be a downright terrible idea."
Sharp Objects,1,To say much more would risk ruining how artfully Sharp Objects unfolds its mysteries.
The Stand,0,"I'll watch the last three episodes, especially to see the new coda written by King himself, but too much of this new attempt to tackle The Stand is full of coughing and mucous, signifying nothing."
Guilty Party,1,"While we like Beckinsale's performance in Guilty Party, the show doesn't seem to have enough story elements to really make us latch onto Beth or her quest to get her career back."
The Outsider,1,"Stephen King adaptations have a spotty track record, one that isn't helped by the sheer abundance of them. HBO's The Outsider bucks those odds, delivering a taut, noir-ish thriller."
Reacher,1,"Though this first series doesn't end as strongly as it begins, Alan Ritchson showcases the right mix of acting chops and physical presence to successfully bring Lee Child's hero to life."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Sure, there's always a hard edge underlying these frothier elements -- this is ex-L.A. Times crime reporter Michael Connelly's Los Angeles, after all -- but aesthetically, it's those frothier bits in The Lincoln Lawyer that rise to the top."
Night Sky,1,"Effective sci-fi mystery or not, as a sharp-edged family drama, Night Sky is a compelling watch."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story shows that even the best artists - Moore, Joan Allen and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisey's sisters, director Larraín and cinematographer Khondji - can give it their all and be hamstrung by the material."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"Episodes which have featured the return of deceased characters have been pretty dull, but there was just something about this particular episode that got everything so right."
Moon Knight,1,"A smart, thrilling adventure that questions the nature of heroism and identity, and also happens to be the best Disney+ Marvel project to date."
The Office,0,"The Season 9 premiere, ""New Guys,"" is as uneven as most episodes have been for the last few years."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Mayor of Kingstown has its problems, sure, but it also has plenty of potential to say and do meaningful things in and around a complex, relevant topic."
Man vs. Bee,1,"Man vs Bee is the most harmless piece of comedy he has been involved in. Unless, of course, you’re a bee. Anyway, don’t pretend there aren’t worse things on Netflix."
Rise,1,"When Rise works best, it's invariably placing these kids at the center; when it stumbles, it's nearly always because the series chooses to tell us how inspired they should be, rather than showing us what happens when they're inspired."
His Dark Materials,1,"The season 2 premiere of His Dark Materials sets up the rest of the season nicely, gently introducing viewers to new worlds, characters and concepts."
A Teacher,1,A Teacher's lessons are all the more devastating for appearing incomplete.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"It took a while to get going...but this became my favorite season, a nail-biting exercise in perfectly-executed tension. I was so pleased with the writing..."
What If...?,1,An animation series that may be the best that the platform has released of late. [Full review in Spanish]
Eureka,1,"The more serious stories were fine, but it was those effortlessly light, entirely un-self-serious touches that made Eureka's short five seasons such refreshing fun to watch."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"All of this is very on-brand for Jessica Jones as a show and for Jessica as a character, so much so that this season has the tendency to feel like something you've already seen."
Battlestar Galactica,1,Battlestar Galatica has defied the odds.
Outer Range,1,You must persevere and embrace the madness else this will become a difficult watch to endure. Two very distinct genres and two very different storylines are squeezed together to make a highly original if polarising series.
Chuck,1,"Hot damn, I'm going to miss what this show did when it was really cooking with gas, which it was on its final Friday night."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Whether read as pure whimsical fantasy or a collection of deep ideas that'd been over-simplified into incoherent psychological symbols, Wonderland was a hot mess."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The perfect show for this format, so you have time to think and build anticipation between episodes. You want more..."
Chucky,1,"This is a solid start to Chucky's latest venture, promising all of the high-camp thrills and spills we associate with the horror icon."
Unbelievable,1,"While not a spotless transition from article to script, it's very much a ""show, don't tell"" portrayal of the real-life events and fallout, which lands in a must-watch spot that is thought-provoking without being preachy."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Amounts to less than the sum of its ambitious parts; intriguing moments of acting and casting that somehow fail to reveal a surprising or enlightening tale.
Devs,1,It's as complex as an Alex Garland creation. But Devs once again proves that the mastermind behind tech thrillers is just beginning with his roster. [Full review in Spanish].
Shining Girls,0,iShining Girlsi ultimately doesnt give us much sense of whats at stake in its byzantine narrative.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage Season 2 satisfies like a warm, rousing crescendo. If you can find the beat and stay in tempo, Mike Colter will pull you along for a smooth ride."
Better Things,1,"The instinct right now is to either lean into the world’s horrors or distract with guilty pleasures. But Better Things is the catharsis we need, because we need to feel."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"The second season might not be quite as tightly wound as the first, but the twisty mystery is by no means an easy solve."
Twin Peaks,1,"It may not be the AARP-approved idea of the state of being old, but that doesn't make Lynch and Frost's efforts here any less poignant."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Much of this new season grapples with crime and other issues within the African American community, not really how the community reckons with outside forces and racism."
Devs,1,"Devs is oblique and obsession-worthy sci-fi storytelling of the highest order, and that it somehow puts its characters first... speaks volumes about the human heat still rising, however improbably, from Garland's electric daydreams."
Better Call Saul,1,"To make a final season the best of a series is a near-impossible task, but by keeping this story level, consistent, and wonderfully written, this cast of characters takes a fairly straightforward story and makes it as intricate as any of Jimmys cons."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"A compelling and crushing story, ""The Shrink Next Door"" is a riveting look at flawed humanity, companionship, greed and the cost of self-worth."
Stranger Things,1,The Duffer Brothers really swung for the fences this season. They were mostly successful.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,[John C. Reilly]’s great in his role as Playboy Mansion enthusiast turned NBA owner; so is Quincy Isaiah as Magic Johnson. And Jason Clarke is over the top as short-fuse coach Jerry West. It’s fast moving and wildly entertaining.
Hawkeye,0,"Steinfeld deserves a better introduction than this piece of tinsel which, in its first two episodes, never transcends the rating of fine."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The acting -- by Winslet and the strong ensemble around her -- is compelling enough to make it all feel more tragic than soapy, more complex than overcooked."
Raised by Wolves,1,"While its two-part premiere feels like a return to status quo, Season 2 kicks off with deepening emotional mysteries. The performances remain impeccable, and the show is still poised to be a haunting exploration of faith and flesh."
The Undoing,1,"""The Undoing"" is bathed in rich, autumnal colors as we quickly get to the trial portion of the proceedings, which of course feature all sorts of goings-on you'd never see in real life. But who cares."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"It's too long and doesn't have enough story to adequately fill 13 hours of television. The many pieces of the puzzle also don't start coming together until far too late in the game as a result, and by that point, it's rather hard to care."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"FX's first true crime series brings a new type of grossness to the genre - one in which the audience feels shameful simply because viewing the docuseries makes us complicit in stroking the ego of its subject, Gary L. Stewart."
Unbelievable,1,"It's an uncommon treat to see such a strong, multi-generational cast of women holding together a work that illuminates a vitally important issue."
The Gilded Age,1,"It's a lot for 80 minutes, but Fellowes manages to sort it out with his usual combination of smart writing and ace casting."
Lisey's Story,1,All the performances are first-rate. Mr. Owen is in rare form -- the role of the wounded child-turned-artist is not something previously in the actor's repertoire. Ms. Allen and Ms. Moore are extraordinary
Inventing Anna,1,"Even as the show around her stutters, Garner leans into her role with a vulpine, barely there grin that proves irresistible."
Russian Doll,1,"Stepping to the forefront of the show’s creative team, Natasha Lyonne has delivered seven episodes that are more personal and take bigger intellectual risks than anything in the initial run."
Twin Peaks,1,Twin Peaks foregrounds a kind of American emptiness of the soul that is filled by violence.
Chloe,1,Erin Doherty's lead performance - implying depth while maintaining a calculating remove and blank ambiguity - makes an otherwise adequate but unremarkable psychological thriller worth watching.
Normal People,1,"Normal People is its most real at these moments, when it shows how coming from a wealthy family gives you an advantage in college."
Undone,1,"With BoJack Horseman and now Undone, Bob-Waksberg and Purdy have really mastered the art of cathartic TV."
Peaky Blinders,1,"The pieces are in position, and Peaky Blinders presents its players -- and its audience -- with a new game plan. Let’s see it if it works."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"A gorgeous, engrossing look at the creatures who used to roam the earth."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Given Schumer's success, the audience is expecting that genius on a rather more reliable basis. I'm sure it's coming, even if it isn't evident right out of the gate."
The Outsider,0,Chris Carter could have nailed this material efficiently in a two-hour X-Files episode.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"The end begins -- evocatively, dramatically."
Moon Knight,0,"Despite the centrality of a mental break to its proceedings, the series largely pretends at psychological depth."
We Own This City,0,"With its pressing social issues and weighty mystery, We Own This City desperately wants to be The Wire and True Detective, but lacks the narrative panache to match the unbelievable twists and turns of the headlines the story is ripped from."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Season two... was a frustrating watch: the pacing felt off, the addition of Giorgia Whigham as Amy didn't quite click, and all in all the season had less drive than its predecessor."
Veep,1,"Veep is satire, parody, farce, pantomime and social commentary all swirled together to create this impossibly hilarious concoction."
True Blood,0,"So endeth True Blood, with the anemia we'd come to expect in recent years."
Loki,1,"Perhaps in its greatest accomplishment, Loki has now changed my perspective on Wilson - for the better!"
Cowboy Bebop,1,"The stories, dialogue, action, setting, and music all had to be in absolute harmony and they were. It's an amazing feat of creativity."
Slow Horses,1,"For fans of spy thrillers, this is definitely for you. And, if youre like me and could take or leave a spy story, I think youll find a lot to like with Slow Horses."
Euphoria,1,"Levinson constructed a singular world with ""Euphoria,"" and in its second season, it's clear he wants to deepen it without losing any of its sense of extremity."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Whether you’re a fan of The Boys or not, you’ll enjoy the animated shorts in The Boys Presents: Diabolical, mainly because they tell good stories with funny character-driven gags."
Suspicion,0,“Suspicion” is another Peak TV offering where the idea gets outdone by the need to break it up into too many pieces that can get tiresome trying to fit together.
Titans,1,"But for the most part, thanks to some major early character deaths and decisions, Titans Season 3 rivals even Batman's darkest tales for their grown-up sensibilities - probably because it's adapting a couple of them at once."
Yellowjackets,1,"I know that ""Lord of the Flies but with girls"" is also the concept for The Wilds, but honestly? I'm here for it."
Russian Doll,1,"A relatively quick viewing experience and, for the most part, a distinct successor to 2019’s original run... But Season 2 ultimately suffers from a lack of momentum and misguided assembly."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"Ready yourself a bit... so you can deal with the fact that awful people can cause a lot of major problems online. But it’s still informative, even if it treats these cases with a bit too much of a sensationalistic bent."
The Wonder Years,1,"""Wonder"" is a wonder in the world of TV reboots."
Midnight Mass,0,"Though it engages with potent ideas, the ultimate impact of Midnight Mass is softened by a lack of follow-through. It's a very talky show that struggles, in dialogue, to answer the questions it poses."
The Good Place,1,"I loved escaping to a world where people are basically good, cruelty is bad, and fairness and justice are worthwhile pursuits."
Black Mirror,1,Black Mirror still feels right - precisely because it feels so wrong.
Stranger Things,1,"For me, this is a perfect followup to season 3 and a great continuation of the story."
Friday Night Lights,1,"This season may be about saying goodbyes, but for now I'm just happy to have Friday Night Lights back."
Normal People,1,"An addictive series which will suck you in, fully consume you for several hours and then spit you out. The acting is incredible, the cinematography is stunning and the music perfectly complements the whole thing."
The Undoing,0,"Kidman is fine from moment to moment, but her character is tossed about so, as facts turn to lies and lies look like facts, that a whole person hardly comes together - she seems held together by shellac."
Fleabag,1,"Perhaps the best six consecutive episodes of a television show you'll watch all year. And without a doubt, the sexiest."
Defending Jacob,1,"[Martell] epitomizes the bullied teens of the post-Columbine era, social outcasts that seek refuge in violent video games, playing out fantasies on dark websites and tortured by their peers on social media."
Bridgerton,0,"While the actors brought it in season 2, there was a spark missing in this season due to the writing, pacing, and production choices."
Altered Carbon,1,"Thankfully, it seems creator Laeta Kalogridis and the series producers have taken this on board, and this time around there's not a ridiculously see-through gown or inexplicable nude scene in sight."
Lisey's Story,0,Larraín is a filmmaker who thinks in images and abstractions. King loves to create extravagantly detailed fantasy universes and the tension between these two approaches isn't always productive.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"It's also not a particularly sexy show, despite sex scenes a plenty. David and Louise's illicit trysts lack chemistry and, while Hewson smoulders entertainingly as Adele... her emotions never properly explode."
Behind Her Eyes,1,There's certainly enough of a draw and not too much of a commitment to at least make taking the plunge worth the effort.
The X-Files,1,"This season, the series, which turns 25 in September, rolls out current news images - North Korea and President Trump, among them - to remind us of those dangers. Still, it doesn't let that overpower the basic appeal of the show."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's an astounding piece of television, but I think I'm going to stick with my initial reaction: Lovecraft Country is ""batsh*t insane,"" but in the greatest way."
Foundation,1,"When ""Foundation"" draws on that core, and manages to make discussions of those questions more intuitive than didactic, it's invigorating to see so many component parts work in tandem."
Gentleman Jack,1,This is not your average period drama.
The Tourist,1,"It's well worth watching this fun, stylish and confident caper, which clearly still has numerous twists up its sleeve and characters to play with."
Dark,1,"In its final outing, Dark's creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese have delivered an ending the show deserved - one that isn't perfect, but befitting."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The material is there, and the execution so far seems up to the task."
Physical,1,What started as an intriguing enough concept gets better in the second season of Apple TV’s “Physical.”
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is the definition of a slow burn series.
Gossip Girl,1,"Gossip Girl tried to sell escapism, and until the recession hit, it succeeded. But when the real world encroached upon its high-society fantasy, the show faced an impossible dilemma."
Black Mirror,1,Black Mirror's 'be careful what you wish for' take on technology is as wired as ever.
The Outsider,0,"Like so many of King's mammoth tomes, The Outsider could easily have been distilled into a movie. Instead, we get a 10-episode slog through crime-drama cliché so oppressive, it threatens to overshadow Erivo's brilliance."
And Just Like That...,1,"Sex and the City could do serious - divorce, cancer, infertility -- but it could do silly as well. Maybe the gals will come out the other end just fine and show us how fab your fifties can be."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,This saga of the families is enveloped in a sweet cocoon of one the best television show soundtracks I have ever heard.
First Kill,1,"First Kill breathes new life into the lesbian vampire genre, while shattering old tropes in the process."
WeCrashed,0,"However, unlike the significantly better The Dropout . . . WeCrashed is a series that lacks a clear point of view and cant decide just what tone it wants to set when exploring the rise and fall of the Neumanns."
Counterpart,1,"Fans of this byzantine sci-fi/spy thriller who muddled through its elaborate, twisty first season won't be disappointed."
Breaking Bad,1,"This was certainly a fitting end to Breaking Bad. Taut, aggressive, mesmerizing. A bit loose in the plotting and logistics, but true and fair to its characters to the bitter end."
The First Lady,0,"The capacity for drama is endless. Unfortunately, The First Lady approaches each woman’s story with the depth of an Encyclopedia Britannica entry."
Euphoria,1,"Euphoria remains one of the most explosive, heartbreaking, and entertaining shows on television. Season 2 started strong and kept getting better, all the way to an impressive finale."
The Office,1,"I laughed, I cried, I kvelled, I nodded along, I ignored doubts, I admired zingers, I marvelled at the restrained use of flashbacks."
Rome,0,"The creators of ""Rome"" took pains to recreate Rome as it really was, crowded, fetid, brutal and corrupt: as much ""Mad Max""as Circus Maximus. But behind all that gritty squalor the glory that was Rome gets lost."
Loki,1,You're going to have to pay close attention to know what the hell is going on in this colorfully convoluted world that is Loki the TV series.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"Together, they deliver anguished, nuanced portraits that are diminished by Levi's interruptions."
Godless,0,"My biggest complaint about Godless is one that could have been avoided entirely, had Frank only realized that if he'd concentrated less on hitting the more basic beats of Westerns, he could explore one hell of a more interesting story buried underneath."
The Sopranos,1,It's still a master-class in building tension. David Chase mines more suspense out of a family talking at a diner as a young woman struggles to parallel park than most pure horror directors could even dream.
Mad Men,1,"It is many things at once, including absolutely fantastic."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Mike Flanagan's Netflix adaptation of Jackson's work makes a family-the Crains-and their twisted collective history the narrative thread. But he manages to keep the focus on engaging female characters while building out a new world.
Shadow and Bone,1,"Some may look at this as counting appearances instead of measuring performances, but all of these actors enliven the script with their portrayals; Young and Suman in particular make Shadow and Bone worth watching."
Lisey's Story,1,"King put so much of his heart into both the novel and onto the screen that you can't help but be moved by it, despite the pacing issues. Of course he didn't want to take too much away in his adaptation: how do you edit a love letter?"
BoJack Horseman,1,"The final episodes of BoJack Horseman are ambitious, but not because there's some grand design to come to a valuable, teachable conclusion. Instead, it simply feels real."
Mr. Corman,0,"Its efforts in trying too hard drowns out any kind of story to connect to, and it's something that no song and dance number or cool montage moment can save."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a huge disappointment considering its star-studded cast and bestselling source material. More than anything else, the Hulu series feels hollow."
Invincible,1,"It's not an entirely new approach for this genre, but the familiarity of Invincible is forgivable in light of the confidence that both Kirkman and Yeun bring to the material. They're the reason to watch."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"All in all, a sweet, gentle, kind, sentimental and congenial wrap. Exactly what fans would expect."
Bel-Air,0,"Do we really need a cool Carlton, a sexy Uncle Phil, or a sad Will?"
Boardwalk Empire,1,"All the various threads seem ready to tie into one another fairly quickly - and with only eight episodes to the season, that's a good sign."
Swagger,1,Swagger isn't just good - it's good in a way that scarcely seems possible for a freshman season.
Alias Grace,1,"... Alias Grace is discomfiting, compelling, deeply insightful television."
Hawkeye,1,"Jeremy Renner reprises his role as the worlds most underrated Avenger, Clint Barton, in this funny Christmas adventure that focuses on friendship and family."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Season two takes a more nuanced approach to its examinations of the fragile dude ego, and the end results are more chilling."
Dark Winds,1,Dark Winds is at its best when focusing on aspects of Navajo culture that give “Dark Winds” a unique flavor and at its most TV-unreal when officers wander into dangerous situations without calling for backup.
The Mist,0,"The Mist is one of the most disappointing series of the summer. I had great hopes for this adaptation of the classic King story, but unfortunately, it didn't meet any of my expectations."
Longmire,1,"It will be interesting to see how and when the show begins to address the finality of things, and whether or not Longmire plans go out big or if it will stay business as usual for the sheriff of Absaroka County."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The end result is a series that’s perhaps best suited for either Money Heist superfans or those entirely new to the franchise. Still, Money Heist: Korea proves to be a compelling watch based on its updated geopolitical context."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The show feels like a really extended movie with a bad villain. It depends too much on the legacy of Steve Rogers with really interesting secondary characters that try to live up to him. [Full review in Spanish]
Narcos,1,Narcos is highly recommended as a terrific thriller and and a timely political parable.
Forever,1,"For eight episodes, Forever has felt cynical about love, ungrateful even, but in its conclusion it shows a glimpse of its beating heart."
The Undoing,1,Plenty of pedigree wattage has been packed into this slickly addictive new HBO drama.
The OA,1,"It's with great joy that I can say that The OA's second season, which took nearly three years to complete, takes the seeds planted in the show's first eight episodes and lets them blossom into something close to a masterpiece."
Younger,1,"In its final episodes, Younger remains as fizzy as the Champagne that gets poured at all those rooftop parties that Liza & Co. get to attend."
Fleabag,1,"While I felt the first series flagged slightly towards the end, this was a dark, stylish return - the telly staple of a tense family celebration, but with sudden twists and writing so sharp it could scratch your eyes out."
WandaVision,1,"My immediate reaction was that it's a charming, exquisitely done, pointless confection."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Wolf Like Me is more drama than comedy, but it works either way, despite its strange premise. Much of that is thanks to Gad and Fisher, but it's also because Forsythe has ground the show's more supernatural elements in reality."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"But whatever Prodigy has planned with its game-changing engine, there's something quite beautiful about a show with so many connections back to Star Trek: Voyager..."
Watchmen,1,"By honoring the past, but moving the property forward, the new Watchmen, created by Damon Lindelof, became one of the year's best television series."
Gaslit,1,"Roberts should get her Emmy speech ready, she is that good. She's like Shelby in ""Steel Magnolias"" all grown up and waking up to the horrors of the world around her that men have created. Sean Penn is unrecognizable as her scumbag husband..."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Mixing tragedy and comedy to stunningly powerful effect, former doctor Adam Kay turns his own experiences into the stuff of TV gold while showing us the stark reality of a routinely under-funded, over-stretched NHS."
The Affair,1,"The drama, well scripted and beautifully acted as ever, continues to play around with time frames as we saw flashbacks to Vik's terminal cancer."
The Witcher,1,"Season 1 of The Witcher started on shaky ground and picked up steam with each episode. The first 6 episodes of Season 2 continue its upward trend, resulting in what is easily one of Netflix's top original series."
And Just Like That...,1,"The girls are back-yes, without Samantha-and there is a palpably different vibe, one that proves there was still one more story left to tell, and a different way of telling it."
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman has a few missteps, most notably in an episode that tries to take on the bureaucracy of insurance companies, but the series more than recovers in the last few episodes."
The Stand,0,"There are some decent moments buried in The Stand, but it's so generally mishandled on the whole that it's not worth slogging through the rest to get to them."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"It is to the Sci Fi Channel what ""The Sopranos"" is to HBO, a show that defied all expectations and became that rarest of beasts: a big, fat hit with a cult following."
The Right Stuff,0,"Not only does this TV version of ""The Right Stuff"" not bring anything new to the table, but it has pretty much every bad habit Hollywood is currently trying to get rid of..."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knights concept is interesting and the execution is ok, but the real question isis it necessary?"
Unbelievable,1,"On Unbelievable, we really see a difference between what happens to survivors who are believed and the ones who are written off from the start."
Y: The Last Man,1,"The absolute revelation of Y: The Last Man is Ashley Romans. As Agent 355, she can pilot a helicopter, perform CPR, kick ass at hand-to-hand combat, run in style and talk her way into any room. She simply exudes confidence. She looks good in anything too."
Ozark,1,Ozark's long farewell is certainly off to a gripping start.
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"While the Marvel branding threatens to overpower, the stories on each episode are strong enough to stand alone."
Midnight Mass,1,Midnight Mass makes up for the somewhat predictable nature of its mystery with the thoughtful and varied ways the characters react to the changes overtaking Crockett Island.
The Leftovers,1,"Pillar saints, sacrificial goats, four horsewomen of the Apocalypse, resurrections, miracles - it's all here."
You,1,"You is gonna You, and it Yous spectacularly. Come for the glass box, stay to find out who goes in it, and watch it all go down in flames because you don't dare to look away."
Chuck,1,A big fat wink to fans. The fifth season looks like a winner.
Heartstopper,1,This is an ideal series for anyone in high school who feels the pangs of being different. It’s realistic but never bitter. You’ll fall for it just like Charlie and Nick fall for each other.
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack has always been easy and encouraging to binge, but this season's more introspective tone highlights the meticulousness and truthfulness of the characters."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The romantic sci-fi drama barely justifies its existence...
The Umbrella Academy,0,"Once the latest blueprint is established, the assorted subplots yield diminishing returns, indulging in strange detours while building toward the inevitable faceoff with the amorphous threat."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"Paced like a bullet and emotionally resonant when it needs to be, Netflix's new Korean zombie show makes for an immensely bingeable 12 hours of TV."
Barry,1,"Season three of Barry sees one of televisions most compelling, darkly comic series stepping back into the light with nary a beat skipped, finding new moral complications for its widening cast of characters without losing its offbeat sense of humor."
Taboo,1,"Tom Hardy's got a knack for playing enraged, muscled antiheroes, and his next small screen role looks to be capitalising on that same skill set."
11.22.63,1,"Its best moments thrum with tension, as when the past rebels against our hero, trying to repel him. You probably shouldn't try to go back to the past. But whether it comes to changing history or reviving a genre, it's too tempting not to try."
WandaVision,1,A mind-bending illusion of TV sitcoms of the past all wrapped up as a gift of intriguing mystery.
Hawkeye,1,"By showing Clint away from Avengers duties, Hawkeye has turned the character's weaknesses across the films-his normalcy and vulnerability-into his greatest assets."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"It is a valuable documentary not only for its subject, but for its ability to walk, in a very pleasant way, through seventy years of TV history. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a fun six part story, though some early and mid episodes are a little lacking it soon picks up, and even then those episodes are often full of great acting from Oscar Isaac as the duel personalities of our “hero”. Wouldn’t say no to more!"
Atlanta,1,"It’s a bold move to start the new season of your Emmy award-winning drama without any of the main characters, but Donald and Stephen Glover are into making art not chasing ratings."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Even the weakest of these stories paints Shadow and Bone's world as rich with lore and history, aided in large part by uncharacteristically noteworthy costuming."
Barry,1,"It was good in its first two seasons and, I am pleased to report, it is still really good in its... third season. Maybe even better than ever."
The X-Files,1,"It's a pleasant, clever, and sometimes inspired reunion with old friends who were right on the verge of wearing out their welcome when they suddenly reminded you of all the reasons why you loved them in the first place."
The Wire,1,"Quite simply, it was the best television drama ever made, and if it's ever surpassed it won't be on this side of the Atlantic. British TV does not have the resources, the scriptwriters or the actors even to attempt something on this scale."
Arrested Development,1,The series' interest in intergenerational idiocy and corruption couldn't be more timely.
Reacher,1,"Reacher doesn't suffer from any illusions about its objectives, serving up an unpretentious action series that's as much a course correction from the movies as an extension of them."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"It's not about causing social paralysis, it's about building a future where online communities can foster better social networks."
Unbelievable,1,"This is based on true events and it is excellent and insightful and important and also works as a straight-up taut, gripping thriller."
Turner & Hooch,1,"Given that many shows struggle to find their footing early on, Turner & Hooch finds its footing very quickly, and I'm excited about what the future holds for the series."
Legion,1,"In a more just world, Legion would be the stuff of conversations at water coolers, or wherever people gather to discuss the amazing these days."
Prison Break,1,"Everyone from the writers to the actors committed to the outlandish nature of the show's later years, and this is where the newest run of episodes squarely lives... and unlike The X-Files, this conspiracy is fun to watch."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets remains too fun to write off just yet. Its gutsiness sets it apart from the usual survival-drama fare, and its performances suggest a deeper story even if we don't know what it is quite yet."
Lovecraft Country,1,"For every fun, if wildly anachronistic, element, Lovecraft Country is always careful to re-center itself on its characters, and their hemmed-in status as Black women and men in 1950s America."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Boasting Kate Winslet in the title role, twisty plotlines, and breakneck pacing, the series earned fans aplenty over the course of its seven-episode run."
The Alienist,1,"Sometimes all you want is a really compelling murder mystery with high production value and compelling characters, and in that way The Alienist: Angel of Darkness delivers."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,This Is Going to Hurt is likely more accurate and more wrenching than most medical dramas that have aired on TV. But that doesn't mean that it's seeing the fullness of what's wrong with women's health care.
Shadow and Bone,1,"Vitally for a genre series in a time when we're all pretty much over grim dystopias, the show has a human heart, a rollicking pace, and an honest-to-god sense of humor."
A Wilderness of Error,1,Even in an era of documentary series riches... this one is quite compelling as well as artful.
Big Little Lies,1,The early episodes of Big Little Lies suggest a masterful extension as the key characters are given meaty storylines to work with.
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Here’s hoping we have more Love, Death + Robots to look forward to in the future. This is one of the best things Netflix has ever allowed to happen."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is an earnest adaptation elevated by strong characters, inspired performances, and the promise of more answers - and more questions - in its inevitable sophomore season."
The Wonder Years,1,The show suggests some of the relationships of the originals without copying them.
We Own This City,1,An Uncompromising And Grim Look At The Modern American Police.
Stranger Things,1,Stranger Things continues to deliver and has come just in time for a studio that needs a viable hit and is a pop culture phenomenon that still feels worthy of discussion.  [Full review in Spanish]
Forever,1,"Forever tackles some big issues about life,...The half-hour show does so in a manner that cleverly pulls the viewer along from episode to episode, even if its answers, while intriguing, aren't quite equal to the buildup."
Foundation,0,"As Hari Seldon, a heretical mathematician who claims to predict the social and political future, Jared Harris is the only bright spot in a cast that seems to be reciting its lines at a green screen and probably were."
Arrested Development,0,The fifth season proves that not every canceled TV series should be resurrected.
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is an MCU departure in both topic and tone, spicing the superhero formula with a cocktail of comedy-horror and a twist of old- school adventure."
The Affair,1,"In a perfect world, this show would have run a tight three seasons, but on a network that has a tendency to run its shows long past its expiration date, The Affair has thankfully been allowed to end on its own terms and not overstay its welcome."
Loki,1,"Marvel has created a vastly different series. Hiddleston thrives, and Wilson owns this role. It may end up being Marvel's best show yet."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"Discovery's action-packed season opener is unlikely to win over any new fans, but it's the ideal introduction to both this year's big threat and the challenges facing Burnham in the captain's chair."
Mindhunter,1,"Maybe everything really is coming up Mindhunter. But in the dark and cruel world these characters live in, it all seems awfully convenient."
Loot,1,"Comedy shows have gotten a little dark of late,with bleak scenarios or introspective sad-com direction replacing belly laughs. However,Alan Yang & Matt Hubbard have crafted a charming venture that effectively utilizes its strong ensemble to maximum impact"
The Gilded Age,1,"Hardly anybody in ""The Gilded Age"" is as pure, or as dark, as they initially appear to be. That's what makes them all so intriguing."
Bodyguard,1,[Mercurio] sprints the thin line between thrilling and tosh.
Loki,1,"Loki can get bogged down in its discussion of timelines and multiverses... but thankfully the creative team keeps the narrative engine humming, filling the screen with eye-catching details."
True Detective,0,"What ultimately sinks this season is the dull sameness of it all... nearly every scene has the same rhythm and pacing, often centered on two or three people conferring solemnly in hushed voices; the show could be titled Men Mumbling About Crimes."
The Leftovers,1,"Each episode is a reawakening, a daring reorientation of characters or setting, and they're all building towards something world-changing."
Counterpart,1,Counterpart Season 2 gives Williams the same opportunity to explore the Emilys in great detail.
1883,1,Taylor Sheridan does it again. This tale of pioneers headed west has it all.
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a massive show, packed to the brim with excellent character moments. It does an excellent job of introducing the title character to the masses, and clips along at a brisk pace. Isaac is a perfect addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"The spirit of Jim Henson is alive and well in this thoughtful and joyous entry into the Fraggle universe. It takes complex concepts and handles them in a simultaneously contemplative, family friendly, and amusing manner. Back to the rock ROCKS."
Watchmen,1,"Though the comic inspires this level of devotion, Lindelof's Watchmen is great precisely because it rarely gives in to that impulse: If Watchmen has a foundational rule, it's that no one is ever cool."
Castle Rock,1,S2 has a morbid magnetism that pulls you in and makes you hit play all over again at the end of every episode.
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,It’s pretty good and frequently satisfying. That’s more than I can say about a lot of television.
Halo,1,"The series boasts an impressive budget used wisely, with distinct production design distinguishing one planetary location for another and spaceships zipping through endless stars. That alone lets Halo keep apace with its contemporaries."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Peter Jackson's eight-hour recut of Lindsay-Hogg's voluminous footage does the impossible -- transforming it into a bright and colourful celebration of friendship, music and the sheer joy of playing that music with friends."
Dr. Brain,1,"An adaptation of Hongjacga's eponymous webtoon that condenses in its six accurate chapters one of the freest, most mind-blowing and addictive TV shows of the year."
WeCrashed,1,The show’s main hook is that it’s genuinely funny.
WandaVision,1,As a loving pastiche of creaky American sitcoms WandaVision is endearing. And Olsen and Bettany are clearly having a hoot in their retro frocks and dad sweaters. But it's that rising dread that will bring Marvel fans scrambling back for more.
Fleabag,1,Phoebe Waller-Bridge reclaims the idea of female coping in Fleabag. It remains a mordant exploration of what comes into play when women aren't made to obsess over terminating the umbilical cord of pain.
Defending Jacob,1,Apple TV+ may have just delivered America's answer to Broadchurch.
The Wire,1,"""The Wire"" is unquestionably the best show on television."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A contrived Netflix reality show as dumb as all the others.
Band of Brothers,1,"Its ten chapters compose an impressive fresco of the conflict, but above all of the soldiers who fought in it. [Full review in Spanish]"
Godless,1,"I can tell you that I did not want to curse my television, and that ""Godless,"" the grimness of its title notwithstanding, goes somewhere almost corny, but kind of beautiful."
24,1,The producers have so embraced the larger-than-life elements of their beloved character that it's hard not to enjoy the show on those terms. We needed a hero in 2001. Maybe we need a superhero in 2014.
Halo,1,The result is a series that manages to evoke many of the core themes and the visuals of the video games while also delivering a compelling narrative.
Lovecraft Country,1,"The largely spellbinding Lovecraft Country will find its base among nostalgic, literary, socially conscious sci-fi devotees as well as special-effects buffs."
"Love, Victor",1,"The final season perfectly closes things out for every character. A bit rushed at times, and it feels far too short with just 8 episodes, yet it comes full circle. Long time fans will be left with a smile on their face, and a tear in their eye."
Defending Jacob,1,"It's a story of the torment of enduring suspicion, seductive in its detail, abetted by a thriller-sized plot twist, and worth all the fatigue its eight hours of uncertainty can induce."
Hellbound,1,"The shows many thrilling scenarios present contemporary parallels with issues that bitterly divide us today, from social inequalities to Covid-19 vaccinations and global warming denialism."
Shining Girls,1,"If you're willing to pace yourself, and let the mysteries of ""Shining Girls"" slowly envelope you, you might be rewarded with an addictive new series."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"""The Mosquito Coast"" draws blood. But it may not be the blood you expect."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,I liked what I saw.
24,1,24 is as much a thrill ride as ever.
MacGruber,1,"Because Will Forte and the rest of the cast commit to making MacGruber as serious as possible, it makes a silly show actually pretty funny."
Rise,0,"... the stakes are so low on this show that any moment of drama, any monologue unrolled by Radnor or one of the other stars, feels more sanctimonious than emotionally impactful."
The Strain,1,"But the series found its way back to top form in its final season, its bleakest yet, as the characters reckoned with their own fates after a disaster left them ostracized from each other and utterly hopeless."
Invasion,0,Perhaps Invasion is a worthy and ingenious effort to subvert the conventions of apocalyptic sci-fi. Or maybe it's just a flop.
Ozark,1,"Ozark is still going strong even as it nears the end, thanks to a stellar cast and sharp writing. Marty, Wendy & Ruth are some of the greatest TV characters of all time."
MacGruber,0,"It's purposefully harebrained, repetitive, and frequently laboured, but the good news is we get to see Laurence Fishburne and Sam Elliott. You've been warned."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere digs so deeply and powerfully into motherhood - along with all the judgment, guilt and failings that are part of the experience - that it hurts."
Watchmen,1,Watchmen reaffirms Damon Lindelof's stature as one of the greatest creators to have ever worked in television. Writers can spend their entire careers creating something that isn't half as special as even one of his shows; Lindelof has made three.
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good season 2 is a wonderful 6 chapters, even if we do want more."
24,0,This abbreviated 12-episode revival may be an improvement because of the way it galvanizes the pace. Turns out Jack didn't need a whole day to save our bacon.
Entourage,0,"Without a compelling storyline since the fourth or fifth season, Entourage feels like it's stuck around this long solely out of habit."
Dr. Death,1,"Hats off to Macmanus and directors Maggie Kiley, Jennifer Morrison and So Yong Kim for their ambitious vision, not to mention the ace cast. At the same time, it's a shame that Dr. Death is too often so dull."
Interrogation,0,The idea of a Choose Your Own Adventure approach to a crime procedural is certainly exciting on paper; it's a true disappointment that it doesn't work in execution.
The Defiant Ones,1,"It's an incredible story, filled with larger-than-life characters, tragedy and folly, glory and ignominy."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Gentleman Jack is disrupting the conventions of one of our most fiercely loved dramatic forms, at a time when we most need them disrupted. It is a masterpiece."
Better Things,1,"In these years of unexpected and sorrowful goodbyes, the ability to delay ones that are within our control is a powerful impulse. Adlon pokes at that concept vigorously in her last 10 episodes."
Altered Carbon,1,"This season is less horrifying, less gruesome and in some ways a little less bombastic, but it's also maybe a little more nuanced or less melodramatic."
Marvel's Runaways,1,[Marvel's Runaways] were a quality start to an already action-packed season with the promise of greatness.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"By pulling from the earliest days of Star Trek, Strange New World manages to walk the tightrope between showcasing what has always made Star Trek great, while boldly forging a new path forward for the franchise."
We Are Lady Parts,1,I desperately need this show to get renewed.
Two and a Half Men,0,"Seemingly designed less to provide closure than as an extended rejoinder to those who have criticized ""Men"" through the years."
Girls,1,Even when Girls infuriated me it always moved me.
Chucky,1,"All told, Chucky's campy mix of satire and slaughter has the potential to draw in new fans while expanding on the Child's Play cinematic universe in ways that longtime fans will surely enjoy."
Euphoria,1,"You never know where you're gonna end up when you ride Euphoria's emotional rollercoaster, but at least you know that you won't be bored. [Full review in Spanish]"
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game lays out its strengths early. The cast are terrific, the action is inventive and brutal and the influences are worn shamelessly."
The Witcher,1,"Mind you, the visual effects team has had two years of COVID delay to really show what they can do, and it's an undeniably spectacular final product showcased here."
WeCrashed,1,Anne Hathaway’s Rebekah Neumann offers a complex portrayal of a woman determined to reach her goals but is stifled by the men around her while watching them expecting her to help them achieve theirs.
Only Murders in the Building,1,Narrative formulas can be deeply satisfying when executed well—and none more so than that of the cozy mystery.
The Boys,1,"In a show packed with gratuitous violence, some of the deepest cuts are emotional."
The Wire,1,"The Wire isn't the most accessible series. The show lays out a lot of plot strands, forcing the question: Where are we headed? Stick with it, though, and you'll see a remarkable tapestry."
Veep,1,"For all that this finale keeps getting described as dark, I was struck by how insanely optimistic that view of American politics really is."
Devs,0,"Even with a pretty fantastic penultimate episode, it becomes much more a garden maze -- unsure of where it really wants to go."
Losing Alice,1,It will definitely resonate with working moms out there...a little bit of Fatal Attraction to it...
Wolf Like Me,0,"Before things take a supernatural turn, they play out like an afternoon Hallmark Channel weepie."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"It just lets viewers watch, and through careful screenwriting, makes them understand. It's not about what choices the characters make, it's about why they make them and what they hope to get out of them."
The Witcher,1,The Witcher's second season is vastly more confident about leaning into the high fantasy and higher stakes of Sapkowski's lore...
The Wheel of Time,0,The Wheel of Time ends up as a disservice to Robert Jordan's books. What could have been a Dune-level masterpiece ends up a middle-of-the-road offering that fails to live up to its potential.
Tokyo Vice,0,"""Tokyo Vice"" has its moments, and getting Michael Mann as the first episode's director is a true ace in the hole. But that's kind of the best trick this show has to offer."
Fleabag,1,Watching her slowly let down that guard and welcome people in finds Fleabag at its most heartwarming and inspiring-two adjectives I never thought I would use to describe this show.
Inventing Anna,1,"Garner is, not surprisingly, fully up to the difficult task of portraying a person with no center, both for laughs and for drama. She is compelling throughout."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad has always been full of whiplash twists and jaw-dropping cliffhangers, and this season doesn't ease back."
30 Coins,1,There's enough going on during 30 Coins to keep a viewer interested.
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Weightier, deeper, funnier, more insightful and more charming. It's also an even better showcase for its three leads, who just might be the most likeable trio currently gracing any series."
Mindhunter,1,"This season of Mindhunter gives us what we want, with our characters getting developed while offering thrilling scenes of tense conversations with killers."
Chernobyl,1,"Rather than bursting into shocking twists, writer Craig Mazin and director Johan Renck build a steadily creeping unease, allowing the scale of the atrocity to sink in with terrible, fitting gravity."
Sharp Objects,1,"It is perhaps [the] intense directorial authorship [of Jean-Marc Vallée] - very few series are entirely directed by a single person - that is most distinctive about Sharp Objects. The mystery is good, but the tone, mood and style are better."
The Boys,1,Executive producer Eric Kripke and the show’s writers find new and inventive ways to freak us out.
Little America,1,"At its high points, the show is beautifully uplifting, never saccharine or melodramatic. It steers away from the overtly political or distressing, but characters' quiet heartbreak in the face of adversity makes for some of the most evocative scenes."
Angelyne,1,"All these different layers of evasiveness, kaleidoscopic perspectives, and slivers of self-mythology feel like what Angelyne might have wanted."
WandaVision,1,A highly unique and entertaining pivot for the MCU. A delightful sitcom showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany with a curious and somewhat chilling mystery afoot.
Squid Game,1,"As social commentary, it mostly works. As a show about brutal, larger-than-life games to the death, it also mostly works... But as far as final acts go, Squid Game stumbled pretty badly."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"This Netflix production adds just enough to merit another return visit, with the understanding that in the current TV environment, it surely won't be the last."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While seeing Stewart at the helm is in some respects reward enough, the producers rely a bit too heavily on that goodwill with a season that, three hours in, feels as if it's barely gotten out of drydock."
Sharp Objects,1,Rarely has Vallée's signature felt so perfectly married to the material: a murder mystery set in a small town where a gothic ghost story hangs thick in the air.
Hellbound,1,"Hitting at various social themes in such a short amount of time is a difficult task, but Yeon Sang-ho gets the most out of his actors and the story to give us a captivating deconstruction of society."
Brave New World,1,Brave New World rings false in the same simple way its novel does now: capitalism just got bigger and more inhumane.
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe's secret weapon was always its understanding of brevity, and in its final moments it leaves the audience wanting more."
Watchmen,1,An inventive and complex series. [Full Review in Spanish]
Adventure Time,1,"Come Along With Me has some of the elements you'd expect of a series finale. There's a wealth of callbacks to moments, catchphrases, and in-jokes from the whole history of the show."
Vikings,1,"Which, again, fun. But for a show struggling to recapture the sense of sweep and character it initially promised, Ivar's new pal is leading him, and us, down a well-trod path to the same bloodied ground."
A Very English Scandal,1,"It is a drama as brutally funny, endlessly clever, justifiably confident as its protagonist; an immaculately-scripted hour that entwines two decades of salient political history with a finely-worked portrait of the English establishment..."
Stranger Things,1,"There's no sense of bloat to Stranger Things Season 4, despite the supercharged episodes."
Hacks,1,"Reconfirms itself as one of the best comedies available. Brilliant, fun, and deliciously chaotic. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Nevers,1,"I've only seen the first episode, but so far? Yes."
Deadwood,1,"It's hard to imagine ""Deadwood"" with a different cast because the current cast makes up one of TV's best ensembles."
Chappelle's Show,1,"The skits from the first Lost Episode find the comedian in top form, picking on subjects ripe to be picked on. But - and here's where pop psychologists could have a field day - one of the topics is himself."
Supernatural,1,"This premiere episode feels like a mix of the old Supernatural and the new. These urban legends fit the aesthetic of the early seasons a lot better, but they're not entirely out of place."
The Outsider,1,The series preserves Stephen King novel's ingenious plot while entirely altering its tone.
Bel-Air,1,"The genre shift means that Banks can’t rely on broadness to win the audience over; luckily, his performance hits the right shade of every emotion he needs to play, from top to bottom."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"Based on a novel by Jenny Han, it's well written and distinctly tender in places, with the extra dimension of also being a coming-of-new-age story for the mums. Nice."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Taylor-Joy excels in the quiet moments, her eyelids narrowing as she decimates an opponent, her whole body physicalizing angry desperation when the game turns against her."
The Staircase,1,One might accuse the show of trying to have it both ways -- decrying our media culture of rapacious violence while indulging in it -- if both halves weren’t so carefully made and so probingly curious.
Big Little Lies,1,Big Little Lies is a must-see - again.
Outlander,1,The season's beginning does struggle with pacing and flow as it sets up all the action and moving parts for the episodes ahead... but there should still be plenty left for Outlander fans to sink their teeth into this season.
The Gilded Age,1,"Once again, Fellowes gives us smartly written characters, filmed in lavish sets and costumes, trying to fall in love. Its not new, but it works."
Succession,1,"Season 3 returns with just as much petty hilarity, punishing woes, and blazing performances as previous seasons with a civil war storyline to keep you hooked on the exploits of these awful rich people."
Breaking Bad,1,"There are so many reasons the show stands out from virtually any other series on TV: the performances, the writing, the direction and, most of all, the creative vision of Vince Gilligan."
Mare of Easttown,1,Mare of Easttown won with the old television scheme. [Full Review in Spanish]
Parenthood,1,I hope we'll continue to have more great father/son moments with Zeek and Crosby. Their relationship is my favorite.
What If...?,1,"For dedicated Marvel enthusiasts, on the other hand, What If ...? might feel inessential. But the prospect of speculative fan-fiction with a stamp of approval will be hard to resist."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight plays out as an insular psychodrama involving the three characters played by Isaac, only one of which... is clearly defined enough to hold our interest."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Watching the show often feels like an out-of-body experience, as if one were watching oneself navigate through high school. This is exactly what makes the show so timeless."
The First Lady,0,The emotional impact is perpetually blunted by a script that feels like a school presentation rather than compelling drama.
Fringe,0,"As Fringe's ambitions have grown, the sense of real risk, danger, and punishment have diminished to close to nothing as the series nears what will likely be an inadequate conclusion."
The Crown,1,"Gillian Anderson is a revelation in the role of Thatcher, giving one of the finest performances of her career."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"It was fun and quick and interesting and I found myself just as intrigued with the adults' storylines as the teens' storylines, which is a rare find for me. It's imperfect, of course, but it was a fast, fun watch."
11.22.63,0,"It may not be worth the price of the subscription, if you don't already have one, but that is a decision you will have to make for yourself, viewer."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"Occasionally, it defaults to broad brushstrokes... Still, it is an elegant education, and its vast library of footage makes for a smorgasbord of queer entertainment."
The Essex Serpent,1,A great example of atmosphere combined with rich acting.
Peaky Blinders,1,"Peaky Blinders returns in fairly bonkers style for its handsome, cinematic fever dream of a final season."
Loki,1,"Loki [has] an offbeat, fun, scenario that fits rather well with star Tom Hiddleston's ability to make such a sly and occasionally morally repugnant character so ingratiating."
Star Trek: Picard,1,Its only right and proper that the Borg return to centre stage as the baddies in Picards solo show
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Let’s just hope “The Time Traveler’s Wife” never visits again in any other screen adaptation.
The Old Man,1,Nice to see Jeff Bridges in a vehicle that deserves him.
Slow Horses,1,"The action and violence, when it does happen, is fast, brutal and efficient. And just as quickly, the show is back to something that occasionally resembles a bleak workplace comedy. It’s an expert juggling of tones."
House of Cards,1,"Robin Wright is such a seasoned pro that she easily dominates the screen with her measured, observant take on the role."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye delivers brilliantly choreographed action, the heart that made people fall in love with Marvel in the first place and a wholesome dynamic between Clint and Kate that viewers will be desperate to see more of."
The Outsider,1,"""The Outsider"" is a largely downcast affair... But it's a compelling lament, one that has its feet on the ground as it reaches into the beyond."
Godless,1,"Godless is a work of confident artistry, casting well-worn clichés and archetypes in a fresh, illuminating light."
Midnight Mass,0,"The series lacks a strong protagonist, and it is that all the time it distracts us with secondary characters to safeguard the mystery."
Community,1,"There's no denying that the magic of the early seasons isn't quite there. However, let's be very clear about this: There is much greatness and joy to be found in those 13 episodes."
Midnight Mass,1,"There are moments where you can really see Flanagan taking it to the next level; a montage set to Neil Diamond's ""Holly Holy"" might be the best single thing he's done yet."
Swagger,1,"Swagger offers up a lot to love, but it's the performances of O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Quvenzhané Wallis that carry the show from good to great."
Waco,0,"Despite a fantastic cast, with a particularly outstanding performance by Taylor Kitsch, the miniseries' desire to make Koresh a folk hero is a miscalculation."
RuPaul's Drag Race,1,"Even if the show no longer seems as novel as it once did, here’s hoping that Drag Race will charge on, blowing minds."
You,1,"As secrets and bodies are buried this season, Joe and Love seem to be in love one minute and arch enemies the next. The most chilling season yet."
Big Little Lies,0,"No one's been handed anything approaching as good a storyline as Streep, not yet - Bonnie's whole narrative is now ""walking"", which gives Zoë Kravitz nothing to work with."
The Old Man,1,"There is plenty of tension, but the real pleasure here is watching an old pro allowed to just be in front of the camera and remind us how it’s done."
Roar,1,"By keeping the stories simple, Roar is able to send its messages without hammering it over viewers’ heads. Could some of the episodes stick their landings better? Sure. But the storytelling in the series mostly solid."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's hard to knock Midnight Mass for taking too much time to think, especially when you consider the alternative."
Chernobyl,1,One of the best series in the history of television. [Full review in Spanish]
Lisey's Story,1,"The execution may be lacking, but the idea of Big Little Lies by way of The Shining is sound."
Yellowjackets,1,"A series that is able to use multiple timelines and elements of different genres effectively, that can keep you guessing and theorizing through clever storytelling and not just by being confusing."
Sweet Tooth,1,Sweet Tooth brings something strange and heartfelt to the ongoing slew of apocalyptic stories hitting the big and small screens... an excellent fantasy about facing a world suddenly changing in ways where one catastrophe impacts every facet of life.
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"It feels like a more mature version of a Disney Channel show, as Lahela encounters death and suffering, but grows (and grows up) in the process."
Watchmen,1,"Will Watchmen catch on with a cold audience? Who knows, but this opener was slick and engrossing."
Normal People,1,"Normal People is beautiful. It sweeps you up in its arms, capturing the very essence of the book ."
Justified,1,"With ""Fate,"" as usual, the best stuff with Justified is often the little stuff: a stray word of dialogue, an Olyphant glance from under the shadow of that Stetson Marshall hat, Goggins' hair. Oh yes, the hair."
Elite,1,"Its campy, its sexy, and its fun to watch. For the most part, Elite ticks all of the boxes that you want it to, and thats all that matters in the end."
Turner & Hooch,1,"Dog-loving teens may enjoy this show, which is relatively tame in most aspects besides the violence, but many will roll their eyes at the cheesy dialgoue and storylines."
Mare of Easttown,1,"While the pacing of ""Mare"" is a little jarring out of the gate, it's ultimately what makes the show stand out from the rest of its ilk. It's as equally interested in the people on screen as it is in the gruesome fate that befalls one of them."
Peacemaker,1,"Anchored by a winningly charismatic turn from John Cena, Peacemaker shows that Gunn can flesh out a previously monotonal character and make him sympathetic, without sacrificing the silliness and subversiveness that most of us love him for."
And Just Like That...,1,Sometimes guilty pleasure is pleasure without any guilt. [Full review in Spanish]
Mare of Easttown,1,The series leaves no police procedural cliché untouched but ultimately transcends its familiarity.
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"But rather than coming off as a boring-but-useful YouTube tutorial, Watch the Sound remains engaging and approachable, even when it gets technical."
What If...?,1,"It's hard to predict where What If will go, but judging by this first episode, the show has a lot of room for improvement if it wants to be the same kind of appointment viewing that its live-action counterparts have proven to be."
Yellowjackets,1,"There's so much to enjoy about Yellowjackets, and I can't wait to see where the series takes us."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is still the Russian Doll we know and love. Its humor, its darkness, its curiosity in the history of the self in the context of greater history let it stand apart in the television landscape."
You,1,"Though it can be overstuffed at times, You balances brazen humor with emotional intelligence, all while keeping the mystery intact."
Godless,1,"... it proves that truer stories can be told-ones that capture the allure of what brought so many westward in the the first place, while more honestly portraying history."
Normal People,1,Normal People is a romance epic that miraculously manages to escape its youthful roots and evolve into something deeply thoughtful and life-affirming.
Freaks and Geeks,1,Mass audiences are only interested in reliving high school if it's sentimentalized. The chance to revisit something remotely in the ballpark of the real thing is as appetizing as cafeteria food-and Freaks and Geeks was a weekly feast of teen awkwardness.
First Kill,1,"First Kill has something few other vampire shows have right now: a super hot, super sweet same-sex romance at its center."
WandaVision,0,"I do want movies and TV to do the basic work of winning me over and establishing the stakes, and I chafe when a relationship is described rather than shown."
Veep,1,"But in the end, if Veep is a show about political addiction, then the seventh season promises a look at what people do to either get sober or lean into their vices full throttle."
Euphoria,1,"It's strong stuff. It's meant to be. ""Euphoria"" is its own kind of twisted high."
Mare of Easttown,1,Just seven episodes have been necessary to hook us with a case full of surprises and a town with a multitude of inhabitants to remember. [Full Review in Spanish]
Search Party,1,"What started off as a Lynchian mystery ends in a completely different style... The series knows how to reinvent itself, sometimes in really wild ways, and becomes something truly surprising and original. [Full review in Spanish]"
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage's second season marks the darkest point of the Netflix Marvel shows to date, and will have you rethinking your definition of 'good' and 'evil' once you reach the ending."
The Stranger,1,"It's an enjoyable and entertaining series that, while it doesn't leave a lasting impression, also doesn't allow any time for boredom."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Not as robust as it could be, Lovecraft Country has some strong performances and strikes a unique balance between actual and metaphorical monsters. Is it worth your time? Absolutely."
Modern Family,1,"The writers had some work to do in terms of pulling it all together, offering a finale that was worthy of the show's mix of big, broad laughs and tender, family-oriented heart. For the most part, the show delivered just that."
Devs,1,"Even if it doesn't go as far as it could, Devs has a tight focus that makes it hypnotic, engrossing television, easy to slip into for an hour at a time or binge all at once if you wait."
Inventing Anna,0,"The series is not nearly fun enough to justify its length, quality, or even existence."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"HBO's Scenes From a Marriage will no doubt be watched by an audience largely unfamiliar with Bergman's original, and if it existed only to provide Chastain and Isaac a chance to display their acting chops it would still be a worthwhile endeavor."
Black Mirror,0,"Season five is a mess, and nothing about it suggests that Black Mirror retains its original, unnerving insight into the ever-blurring borders between the digital and the human."
Alias Grace,1,"Sarah Gadon's exhilarating performance inhabits and subverts all the extreme adjectives thrown Grace's way, leaving you with a memorable character whose lingering unknowability is her greatest strength."
Band of Brothers,1,"[Damian] Lewis, whose noble, understated characterization of Winters is truly an inspiration, deserves every award television can throw at him."
Shining Girls,1,"Bell certainly deserves kudos for playing so damn skeezy. True to the disturbing book character, he sets your teeth on edge."
Trying,1,This is a show that just plain wants you to be happy while you're watching it.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"""Arcane"" achieves a feat for CGI animation in a made-for-streaming series."
Silicon Valley,1,"""Exit Event,"" the Silicon Valley final episode, wraps the individual and shared stories of Richard, Dinesh, Jared, Gilfoyle, Monica, and their collective nemesis Gavin Belson in a proper and satisfying way."
Bridgerton,1,"It may falter a little in one of its subplots, but the developments within the Bridgerton family, the central romance, and the saga of Lady Whistledown ensure that this follow-up is far from a disappointment."
Inventing Anna,0,"As a true-crime nerd, I followed the story, and I thought it would be an interesting tale to dramatize. Yet, what came about was... a mess."
Veep,1,"What makes ""Veep"" masterful is how it understands true satire. In this seventh season the show brilliantly tears apart the very nature of campaigning."
The First Lady,0,Historical figures work best as drama when we can suddenly relate to them. These first ladies are portrayed as so superhuman that they remain as distant as the faces on our currency.
Loki,1,"Loki's first season was a triumph, full of great performances, effects and lots of amusing timeline shenanigans plus a great finale that sets up so much to come in the MCU."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Hopefully, This is Going to Hurt will get more people to talk about our utterly broken institutions so we can finally do something about it before it is too late."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It fulfills Jeff Bezos's alleged demand that Amazon develop its own ""Game of Thrones"" - in the most unspecial manner possible."
Moon Knight,1,"It establishes the Marvel miniseries not just as add-ons that wrap up stories from already-established names and faces, but rather as a tool that can stand on its own as a functional, exciting, and informative piece in the larger Marvel story."
Earth to Ned,1,"A worthy successor to Muppets Now, Earth to Ned's strongest asset is its cast of characters you can't help but root for -- which is good, because these goofballs really have no idea what they're doing."
The Wonder Years,1,"Put it this way: if the original Wonder Years was the coming of age story of the Arnold family, then this Wonder Years is aiming to tell the tale of the coming of age of our America."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is over-stuffed with plot and under serves its characters, but it fits the bill of empty summer TV."
24,1,"I can't imagine how [it] looks to a novice viewer, but as a longtime fan who came to embrace the show's ridiculous core, it's slightly thrilling to slip back into the old rhythms, to feel my pulse quicken in time with that accelerating countdown."
Sharp Objects,1,"Adapted from a 2006 novel, Sharp Objects is unusual, but not in a bad way. Often creepy and disturbing."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is so bewilderingly convoluted as to be almost invulnerable to spoilers. It is less immune, however, to criticisms of lacklustre scripting, tortuous plotting and pseudo-philosophical musings about human nature and identity."
The Act,0,The story here... just drags on where a quicker pace would clearly be more effective in a journey where the destination is already determined.
Dr. Brain,0,Dr. Brain jettisons the most intriguing parts of its own setup in favor of a missing persons mystery that ultimately lands where so many other rogue scientist stories lead.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"The constant swirl of dramatic action, bigger-than-life characters and obsessive drive make “Winning Time” impossible to resist."
Chappelle's Show,1,"Sure, you'll laugh loud and long at this first ""Lost"" episode -- and, obviously, that's what's important. But these episodes have a memorial quality to them and, like fame itself, their impact feels fleeting."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The series itself is beautifully shot, with lush cinematography and a high production value that makes each episode feel cinematic."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,Somehow the blend of medical drama and teenage growing pains really works.
Marvel's Runaways,1,"The chemistry within the ensemble - the playful banter, as well as its kookier elements - make this third season of Marvel's Runaways a distillation of what's always been fascinating."
The Staircase,1,"As Kathleen, a high-flying executive who appears to be falling out of love with her husband, Toni Collette gives convincing voice to a woman who was little more than a series of gruesome forensic photographs in the doc."
Eureka,1,"The sheer craziness of the moment and Carter's reaction of ""I'll worry about that tomorrow"" was all-Eureka and a perfect way to end things."
Hannibal,1,Hannibal's audience must also juggle tough questions along with macabre and stunning imagery.
The Capture,1,"This is a great-looking, well-paced, timely thriller, with excellent work by Turner, Haddock and Grainger, and scene-grabbing supporting work from Ron Perlman and Famke Janssen."
The Staircase,1,This nonlinear reexamination is as much about a possible murder as it is society’s insidious fascination with horrible tragedies.
Severance,1,"""Intelligent and intriguing. Intelligent and intriguing. We imagine the hell and we created it.""  Full Review in Spanish -Letras Libres"
Project Blue Book,1,[I]t's as good as ever.
Alias Grace,1,"It's so heavy throughout the first installment, you might wish for at least one of the characters to open a parlor window and let in some air, but as the story progresses it becomes too engrossing to turn away."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"I am, without a doubt, completely entertained and on the hook for more. So regardless of what's actually going on here, it's definitely working."
Big Little Lies,1,"Characterization trumps plot twists every time, and the series is better for it. Above all else, the show explores the pain that families inflict on one another."
Joe vs Carole,1,"Joe vs. Carole can offer more empathy for its subjects. They may be their own worst enemies when they go in front of cameras, but these actors and filmmakers can see their souls."
The Right Stuff,1,"What it loses in momentum, however, this Disney+ series gains in its characterizations, offering a satisfying voyage back into the stories of the men at the center of the Mercury 7 space program, as well as the women that loved and/or endured them."
WandaVision,1,"A love letter to sitcoms and the perfect show to bring us back into the MCU, WandaVision is Marvel's most exciting project yet,with an unmissable, Emmy-worthy performance from Elizabeth Olsen."
The Defiant Ones,1,"Mature, insightful docu about unlikely hip-hop partnership."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,Inside Amy Schumer upped the level of naughty sketch comedy last season and seemingly keeps up the pace as season four starts.
Scandal,1,"[Olivia] might be gone, but her legacy is permanent."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Frankly, Sweet Tooth is premiering at the right time. Even though some may roll their eyes at a story that kicks off with a pandemic and a lingering virus threat, we can all relate to this material in some way. It's the hope that sticks with you."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is relentlessly bleak, but it has a remarkable cumulative power."
Girls,1,"Despite all the ink the series has gotten over the years, Girls is essentially a hipster soap opera - occasionally clever or smart - but not as revealing as it led you to believe."
Godless,1,There's something about the grim beauty of Godless and its first-rate cast that makes me want to take my time with it.
Undone,1,It’s a masterful way to reexamine all the most potent ideas without the show feeling like it’s repeating itself.
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education keeps getting better because it approaches storytelling the way it teaches us to approach sex - with curiosity, excitement, and a willingness to learn."
The White Lotus,1,"If you can't find something in here to enjoy, you're just not trying very hard."
The O.C.,0,The series used up three times as much plot as any other drama around. It burned through whole arcs of character development in one episode and started repeating itself.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"All nine short films aren't going to appeal to everyone, but there's still plenty to love about the ambitious Star Wars: Visions, even if you're not a fan of anime or the franchise itself."
The Night Of,1,"The worst gap between rigorous style and ridiculous substance fortunately comes early in ""The Night Of,"" which is why I can argue honestly that you should push through it to what comes after."
Fringe,1,"We're all in this together, Fringe fans, watching to see how these last 13 episodes play out."
The Sopranos,0,"For six seasons, the crime drama seemed worthy of being considered a work of art. But last night felt far too much like TV as usual with all its commercial compromises and unfulfilled promises."
The Nevers,1,"The series is ripe with relevant and important discussions to be had, and has a world that is easy to get immersed into. As far as the first episode goes, it has done it's job."
Dark,1,"Dark's third and final season on Netflix is a memorable journey through time and space, with thrilling character shifts and fascinating paradoxes to unpack."
WeCrashed,1,"It’s open for debate whether this decade of exuberance was good for the wider economy, but one thing is now apparent: it makes for great TV."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Basically, Iron Fist heard all the complaints about Season 1 and was like, ""I'll show you!"" And then it did."
Yellowjackets,1,"Creators and showrunners Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson are quick to dole out the plot twists, too, while ably balancing timelines and a parade of complicated lead characters. An hour with these women flies by."
Midnight Mass,1,This type of horror leaves a mark. It's as though Flanagan became such a quick study of what makes Stephen King's small-town horror tales resonate and is now primed to outpace the master.
The Night Of,1,Riz Ahmed's Naz navigates an extreme incarnation of a tightrope that those with immigrant heritage must walk.
The Staircase,1,"It’s a pro job. But if you’re interested in the facts behind the fact-based fiction, there is little new to learn."
The Great,1,Huzzah.
Lost,1,Lost has still got it.
Altered Carbon,1,"Boasts a leaner, more easily digestible cyberpunk thriller than its predecessor with surprise new sleeves, new characters and superbly crafted action."
This Way Up,1,"The series' sensibility is so unlike American sitcoms, worlds apart and far edgier with leads you only grudgingly like. A wild experience."
Loot,0,"Though Loot has a more-than-capable lead performer and a talented ensemble surrounding her, this Apple TV+ comedy digs a narrative hole for itself that it takes an entire season to climb out of."
Lisey's Story,0,"Even though there is an actual Lisey's Story in Lisey's Story, it's a story for Lisey from Scott; not one of her or by her."
Dark Winds,1,"McClarnon gives a powerfully measured performance, as if Leaphorn’s grief and anger can only be vented one teaspoon at a time."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Classical, but innovative, precious in the visual but without more squeamishness than necessary, Mike Flanagan distances himself from the cinematic trends with a series full of interesting details. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Taboo,1,Some of my tolerance is thanks to Hardy and his capable co-stars. Some of it thanks to Taboo's sumptuous period detail... There's enough intriguing stuff here to keep me watching.
Severance,1,"If you’re looking for an enthralling new mystery with a distinct visual style to dive into, Severance is a must-watch show."
Dark Winds,1,A heartfelt and accomplished thriller that doubles as a proof of concept for Camel Rock Studios’ ability to tell Native stories in popular television genres.
Stranger Things,1,"Suffers from some growing pains early on, but once the series finds its grooves, it takes it horrors to new levels and deepens the complex history of Hawkins."
Unbelievable,1,"Measured in many aspects and mercurial in other ways, Unbelievable is unmissable."
Stranger Things,1,"Like Stephen King, [the Duffer brothers] take all the pop culture they consumed as children and bring it back to life... [Full review in Spanish]"
Lisey's Story,1,"With a dreamy, surreal tone, director Pablo Larraín navigates an introduction to a story about who owns intangible things like memory, passion, and creativity."
Band of Brothers,1,"The brilliance of Lewis in this is that he finds a way to make the ordinary aspects of Dick Winters seem extraordinary, rather than trying to play him as an overtly extraordinary man."
Moon Knight,1,"Just like Iron Man, one gets the feeling that Moon Knight -- if it can hang onto its sense of mystery and adventure -- just might be the start of something much, much bigger."
The Witcher,1,"So far, The Witcher Season 2 holds on to just enough of its arched eyebrow to survive; here's hoping it remains the show so many became addicted to in the first place."
Fargo,1,"Fargo wouldn't be Fargo without snow, a lot of blood dripping on the snow, and very bad baddies beaten... But, on top of that, this season has become almost Lorca. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Trying,1,"Trying managed to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump in its second season when all is said and done. The writing was tighter, and the acting remained stellar, and there are many possibilities as we head into Trying Season 3."
24,1,"Damn it, Jack and Chloe! It's good to see both of you back on my television screen again."
The Night Of,1,The Night Of shrewdly demonstrates how our desire for a good story can blind us to the truth.
The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones tells a compelling story and tells it effectively and well, but its bloated length is a bit hard to justify."
Banshee,1,"While we expect shows to make bold moves as they near the conclusion, Banshee's shift as displayed here took some legitimate gumption."
Narcos,1,"The continuity provided by the theme music aside, Narcos Season 3 essentially functions as the start of a brand new series under the Narcos umbrella -- a backdoor anthology, if you will."
Big Little Lies,1,[Meryl] Streep's scenes with [Reese] Witherspoon and [Nicole] Kidman are high camp played in deliciously low key style.
Scorpion,1,What is going to make Scorpion super interesting this season is the balance between Paige and Walter now that there's an official relationship on the books.
Only Murders in the Building,1,"“Only Murders in the Building” mashes up high comedy and carefully observed human moments and Season 2 is a continuation, and deepening, of that."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"If this does indeed prove to be the final season- rumors abound that there will be a movie, or at the very least, a spin-off of some sort- then it certainly started with a bang, if this episode was any indication."
The Old Man,1,"Much of the show’s success comes down to Bridges, who anchors a rickety character visibly battered by the past yet able to shapeshift in the present."
1883,0,I can't emphasize enough how much unearned credibility the series gets from Elliott's performance.
Twin Peaks,1,"You don't go to Lynch for coherence anyway. You watch his work because you want to experience his open-air id, his uncorked subconscious, working through a dream-logic that requires a viewer to let go and groove on whatever Lynch throws at you."
Taboo,1,"Hardy rocks the period clothing, strutting around in an open overcoat practically down to his ankles and a commanding stovepipe hat. With anyone else, this show would not be half as engrossing."
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight makes a case for its watchability through its pulpiness and its weirdness.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Gloriously weird, refreshingly progressive, and happily pulling out every stop on the way to the alternate timeline plot generator, The Umbrella Academy is its own damn animal, and indifferent to any gripes from those unwilling to climb aboard."
Forever,1,"Armisen provides a perfect foil, while Kym Whitley...brings big energy and Catherine Keener a delightfully contrasting sharpness."
Normal People,1,Normal People is an experience as much as a television series. It is not to be missed.
Friday Night Lights,1,It's a bittersweet ending for the show and viewers.
The Wheel of Time,0,It's genuinely baffling how perfunctory the storytelling feels in The Wheel of Time.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey is a contemplative and winding drama that offers both Samuel L Jackson and Dominique Fishback a compelling showcase for their many talents.
The Gilded Age,1,"[Writer-producer Julian Fellowes] gathers together bits of Edith Wharton, Henry James, William Dean Howells, Theodore Dreiser, and others, and deploys them in service of his own smart, sly, and delectably soapy storytelling purposes."
Key & Peele,0,"There was also room in the finale for some of the pop culture-inspired silliness that ""Key & Peele"" does every bit as well as the hot-button subjects."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets sets up a fascinating mystery that feels inspired by the rawest parts of Alive, The Lord of the Flies, and Lost, which are now stitched together into this gory potboiler."
Slow Horses,1,"A grimily authentic espionage yarn populated by a bunch of funny, intriguing “losers, misfits and boozers”, as they’re described in the lyrics of the wonderfully atmospheric Mick Jagger theme song."
Severance,1,"As high concept television goes, Severance is pretty lofty, but its ambition is compelling -- not least because it might just be the bulls--- jobs backlash we’ve been waiting for."
Marvel's Runaways,1,"Whilst the third and final season of Runaways is not thoroughly developed, it's a bold and poignant farewell that's tasked to reattach the dangling threads left from last season, while still admirably introducing a spellbinding new menace"
Justified,1,"The final season is primed to explore what the end means for Raylan, Boyd, and Ava, and whether or not the good days are truly gone forever."
The Expanse,1,The best science fiction series of the past decade is going out on (mostly) its own terms.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"It's off to a promising start, with a solid crew brimming with potential. By going back to the past, Strange New Worlds points the way to a brighter future."
The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth plays Michael Peterson and does it with a rare kind of skill. If you think the case has been mined enough already, your mind is changed by Firth’s extraordinary subtlety as a man of many secrets and delusions."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The Queen's Gambit is quietly terrific.
The Essex Serpent,1,Symon’s take works perfectly well as a drama that delivers suitably sinuous twists...
The Gilded Age,1,"Like Fellowes' other period dramas, ""The Gilded Age"" has zip. It's not stuffy or fusty."
Detroiters,1,Season 2 doesn't just improve on the show's stellar rookie year; it catapults the sitcom to must-see status.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,There can only be so many twists and turns with only a couple of episodes left before the series finale.
Irma Vep,1,"Like a lot of film school products, it's full of scathing wit and overheated erotic undertones and a little weak on narrative. And it's a lot of fun to watch, though the first person to announce ""what it means"" will get a hard slapping."
Bel-Air,0,This series has a long way to go before it earns its crown.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Are all 9 episodes bangers? Nuh uh. But for every weird story about a twin brother who has to piledrive his sister's chest because she went evil, you get a darling tale about a robot Jedi."
Stranger Things,1,"Season 4 may not be the best the show has ever been, but it’s definitely the most the show has ever been."
The Defiant Ones,1,"It's boilerplate Great American Dream-type stuff, but it works."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"At 81 years old, Patrick is as commanding as ever as Jean-Luc, perfectly portraying the character’s frailty as well as his inner and outer strength."
Angelyne,1,"The storytelling of Angelyne leaves a lot to be desired, but Rossum’s performance cuts through the script gymnastics..."
The End of the F...ing World,0,"If the first season came across as an update on Natural Born Killers, the second begins with a very strong Kill Bill vibe. Unfortunately, it's a vibe the season can't sustain."
Outlander,1,"Outlander gives us a gentle, suspenseful ""calm before the storm"" opener for Season 6, though to know the show is to know there's always a storm coming."
Calls,1,"Experienced as either an ensemble piece or individual act one plays, Calls is consistently satisfying and never outstays its welcome."
The Outsider,1,Molly is already one of the female characters of the year. [Full Review in Spanish]
Wolf Like Me,0,"It has a true bleeding heart, gushier than a lot of other rom-coms, but it could use a lot more bite."
The Mist,0,"Episode one's more of a family drama than a thriller, and unfortunately the family at the center of the action is not at all compelling."
Roar,0,"A series of one-line set-ups are expanded into eight (mostly) lacklustre episodes in Apples Roar, an ill-advised attempt at wokeness that ends up doing a disservice to its many relevant ideas."
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac is brilliant & hilarious, able to switch between the two personas effortlessly. He's the reason that got me hooked. If he were the only actor on the show, I'd still be entertained even when I don't always know what in the world is going on."
Loki,1,"The new MCU series is a time traveling crime thriller. The first two episodes are heavy on the exposition between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston, and light on the action but it is full of intrigue with a set up that'll keep viewers tuned in."
"Love, Victor",1,"Love, Victor is aware of its lane and it’s pleasantly happy to stay on cruise control for its last set of episodes. That might sound like I’m being sarcastic, but “approachable high school fairy tale” is a vibe, and they’re right to ride it."
Warehouse 13,1,It didn't take long for both storylines to get up and running on Monday.
Foundation,1,"I'll just thank the science-fiction gods that Foundation, often considered an impossible-to-adapt Isaac Asimov property, received such a lavish, compelling treatment."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"This hugely compelling American documentary series begins with the story of the fatal swatting of an unsuspecting man in Wichita, Kansas."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"It was an effective double ending, the two story lines corresponding and playing off each other in parallel goodbyes."
Stranger Things,1,"If season 4 never quite delivers the gleeful sugar highs of 3, it nonetheless stays on track more satisfyingly."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"At its best, the Kelley legal drama has real bite and something to say. In The Lincoln Lawyer, working off of a novelist’s script, Kelley amasses incident -- personal and family drama along with court cases -- but doesn’t quite pull it all together."
Invincible,1,"Much like Amazon's massive superhero hit The Boys, it incorporates the iconography and character archetypes of more popular properties to give viewers something that still feels familiar and inviting."
Amazing Stories,1,"The color, settings and lavish social detail are mainly what distinguishes this enterprise -- an adventure well worth an hour's viewing."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,Back To The Rock reinforces the scale of Henson's original achievement while (subtly) broadening the scope of the series' storytelling.
Reacher,1,Theres undoubtedly more to come from Alan Ritchsons impressive take on the beloved investigator  signalling a bright start to his small-screen adventures.
Jersey Shore,1,"Some brilliant, beleaguered producer made the editorial decision to juxtapose the photo of the balls on the cake next to footage of Mike and Pauly eating the cake, which made for the best split screen moment of the show, or any show, perhaps ever."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Equal parts sinister and disarming, Grant's Jeremy makes the film work."
Mind Over Murder,1,"The first side of the documentary is sometimes repetitive and the second side underserved, but Mind Over Murder remains a provocative thing, defying any kind of simple hero/villain/victim classifications."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of the best performances in his career in the new six-part The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.
Modern Family,0,"The two-part series finale they delivered Wednesday night had the right idea - breaking up the extended family, a gentle goodbye to this stage of things - but the execution was quite uninspired."
The Crown,1,"Together, Thatcher and Diana give The Crown an energy and a sense of direction it lacked in the third season, and a feeling of verve the show has arguably never approached before."
The Act,1,"""The Act"" is a compelling narrative to add to a post-#MeToo world. Men abuse power and sexuality of women, and in this case, a woman is abusing her power and sexuality of another woman (specifically her daughter)."
Reacher,1,"Reacher isn’t a game-changer by any means, but if watching a clever, brash, often-shirtless hulk of a man hammer his way through a mystery is your bag, then you’re definitely in for a treat."
Chernobyl,1,"It doubles as a warning about who pays the cost when the hard facts of science butt up against political agendas, whether decades ago on the other side of the Iron Curtain or here and now. Some bad decisions have half-lives that last for centuries."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Very few dramas manage convincingly to pull off making you laugh out loud one moment and feel profoundly sad the next. Ricky Gervais is the master of this with After Life, and This Is Going to Hurt achieves a similar feat in being painfully funny."
The Crown,1,"Brilliantly compelling television that you will absolutely rattle through. A huge turnaround from the previous season, with much more excitement provided by newcomers Thatcher and Diana. A triumph."
Invincible,1,One of the best superhero series out there. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Sopranos,1,"Chase had a grand time in his almost playful home stretch, offering a clue-strewn valedictory episode and a beautifully unresolved stopping point."
Mare of Easttown,1,Kate is marvelous; she truly is Mare. She disappears into this role!
Amazing Stories,0,"Amazing Stories may well be kicking against the gloomy, dystopian tone of modern anthology TV, but if it's to hold its head above water and justify its existence, it needs to at least try to be a bit more amazing and significantly less unexceptional."
Killing Eve,1,"With an attachment as twisted and complex at its center, Killing Eve can only aim its sights on a finale that ends with a bang rather than merely a whimper."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"I'm going to remember those writing credits, and that little hat tip to the fact that indeed, nobody, not even insanely powerful television showrunners, accomplishes anything alone."
The First Lady,1,Michelle Pfeiffer holds you in the palm of her hand as Betty Ford.
Unbelievable,0,The series feels like a vehicle built merely to convey the information dug up by its progenitors.
Barry,1,"Given the moment of cultural backlash we’re living through, Barry feels eerily on the pulse. Always bleak, the supposed comedy is inching ever further into horror."
Love Life,1,"It's a smart showcase for a talented actor who seizes it with both hands, giving the rom-com genre a jolt as welcome as it is overdue."
The Wheel of Time,1,It is a beautiful fantasy show and should not be compared to other fantasy shows like Game of Thrones because it's already its own entity.
Warrior,1,"There is a power that comes with a series like Warrior, one that hits harder than any punch...Warrior Season 2 is off to a strong start that sets the expectations for episodes to come by telling audiences exactly where it stands."
Vigil,1,"No-one is going to give this set-up Das Boot, particularly after a corker of an opening episode."
True Detective,1,"Ali's performance is the only thing disguising how rote this all feels, and how much the series keeps repeating itself, within seasons as well as across them."
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks and Geeks is tapping into something primal: adolescents' hunger to begin to understand themselves and their world. Freaks and Geeks is too honest to offer answers. But it affirms the value and the universality of asking the questions.
Unbelievable,1,Kaitlyn Dever's heartbreaking performance as the vilified Marie will make you desperate for vindication.
Russian Doll,1,The show is a shining example of how the sci-fi genre doesn’t have to consist of laundry lists of nonsense fake science terms and explosions; it can be used to tell thoughtful stories that speak to the roots of human nature.
Watchmen,1,What's particularly fascinating about the beginning of Watchmen is how it doesn't lean too much into the science-fiction aspect of the world.
Friday Night Lights,1,"Friday Night Lights, at its best, was utterly unique viewing, gut-rattling and occasionally almost suffocating. Like family, it could leave you smiling or sobbing. Or, on occasion, both."
24,1,"As long as all you ask of it is more familiar twists and backstabbing, you'll probably be happy with it."
Queer as Folk,0,"There’s plenty of emoting going on, and the issues at stake are clear enough, but there’s not enough character depth and warmth in the air. The characters seem self-absorbed, and, alas, their romantic histrionics and struggles didn’t move me."
Black Mirror,0,Compared to the deep imaginative voyages of previous series... the new season feels woefully underpowered.
Mare of Easttown,1,"""I know you're worth saving,"" a character tells Mare at one of her lowest points. We should all be lucky enough to have someone say those words to us someday."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Admittedly, The Wheel Of Time got off to a flawed, exposition-heavy start... But with a little more patience and investment, you will be rewarded with a much-needed escape."
The Americans,1,"As always, excellent."
Band of Brothers,1,"After watching the 10-hour ""Band of Brothers,"" I'm so drained by the intensity of what I have just beheld that I'm ready to declare this World War II miniseries the finest piece of work ever produced for television."
Rick and Morty,1,"It's all incredibly bleak, and somewhat shocking, but incredibly good TV while it lasts."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Rapturous.
The Afterparty,0,The series attempts to navigate a deceptively tricky balancing act between murder mystery and comedy.
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Ironically, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is the only content Marvel has ready to go. The good news is the final season is looking quite strong."
Mindhunter,1,"What Mindhunter does with the story is notable-for a series inspired by the memoirs of a profiler, it nevertheless makes the surprising choice to challenge the very foundations of psychological profiling."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"While Mike Colter and Alfre Woodard deliver solid performances, there simply isn't a compelling story worth exploring."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,Still one of the most successful drama series ever put into syndication.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Roger Ebert used to say that no good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough. ""The Beatles: Get Back"" is an interesting test of that premise."
WeCrashed,1,"It’s a tale for our times, and while it occasionally lags, “WeCrashed” catalogues a changing work environment to perfection."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,McCarthy doesn’t star in the series so much as crush it.
Mare of Easttown,1,"It's both moody and atmospheric like the slow-burning Top of the Lake or True Detective, while being as propulsive as a Dan Brown paperback. By taking the best elements of both and dumping the rest, Mare of Easttown is unstoppable."
Yellowjackets,1,"There is something incredibly bingeable about [Yellowjackets] in that the writing keeps building on itself, growing in potency as we get to know these characters better and better, courtesy of one of the best ensembles of the season."
True Detective,0,"Yet again ""True Detective,"" after a drawn-out hiatus, capitalizes heavily on atmosphere, artistry and the celebrity aura of its star players, at times focusing more emphatically on this garb than the integrity of its narrative skeleton."
The Nevers,1,"Even when it errs towards the silly, it's fun and twisty enough to be an engaging page-turner of a show that should grow its own fanbase without much trouble."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"The Earl of Grantham having made a tectonic plate shift in his mind set over a myriad of matters. He's up to speed with the changes of the century, but are the fans, as we prepare to say our final good byes?"
The Essex Serpent,1,"The Essex Serpent deals more in what we uncover by searching within ourselves, and by allowing those we love to really see what we were once willing to leave buried deep beneath the surface."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"The adapted Little Fires Everywhere does contain enough bad behavior to make it a guilty pleasure. Even if guilt is the principal ingredient that the show is missing, and to a fatal degree."
Game of Thrones,0,"The current, final season of HBO's Game of Thrones is swinging and missing on both fronts (the production quality and writing) as a hurried journey toward the finish line is ultimately hurting the series and possibly its legacy."
Sex Education,0,"For the first time, Sex Education seems to be trying to figure out what type of show it wants to be."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"A bigger, funnier, more ambitious season."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"It looks expensive enough, if you're in the market for bland Pottery Barn interiors and blazers with gold buttons. But, boy, is it boring, a tedium that is the result both of the hackneyed way that character is signalled, and its improbable plot."
The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""The Staircase""...is that you can watch all 13 episodes and ultimately still not be able to decide whether the protagonist, Michael Peterson, is guilty or innocent."
Preacher,1,"Whether or not Preacher will adhere precisely to Ennis's original ending remains to be seen, but there's reason enough to continue watching to find out."
Friday Night Lights,1,I'm generally impressed with how well the final season wrapped up.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers may not be five-star TV, but for an audience starved for indulgence, it does the job."
Watchmen,1,"I'm still not sure Lindelof is wholly in control of the subject. But he earns the chance to show that he has a thought-through long game, that he's working with something more than magic dust and good intentions."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Wonderland is kind of dark, kind of confusing and only moderately entertaining."
Limitless,0,"McDorman is solid as an Everyman-turned-Superhuman, and Carpenter... is perhaps the most welcome sight of the fall. Still, one can't help wishing she were in a more inspired role and a less worked-over concept."
The First,1,"The First delivers, handsomely."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,What makes this rendition of Jackson's story so fascinating is the role femininity and domesticity plays in possessing the lives of a couple and shattering their family so completely that only a tragedy can bring them together as adults.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The Umbrella Academy season three is another brilliantly bonkers instalment, pairing the trademark dysfunctional-yet-touching family dynamics with fantastic fight sequences & another banging soundtrack."
The Umbrella Academy,1,The Umbrella Academy has found a formula that works and manages to make it feel new each time. I enjoyed this season quite a bit because it offered a return to established characters but manages to make them even more interesting than before.
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"The two-part doc showcases all of the icon’s incredible career across 50 years and shows sides of him that most have never seen before including the earliest routines of the legendary comedian, as well as intimate details of his personal life."
Hellbound,1,"Train To Busan's Yeon Sang-ho has crafted an eerie, twisty police procedural that uses supernatural ideas to explore far grander concepts around death and sin."
Fringe,1,"Fringe's final two hours were constructed as a big, action-packed adventure, an outline that served its finale well..."
Roar,0,"Some of these are so on the nose, they lose their creative energy because they're so obvious."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,Four hours spent listening to George Carlin is four hours well-spent.
Defending Jacob,1,"Perhaps its dour tone would have bothered me less if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic, but that's just the world we live in. As such, I would say that Defending Jacob is worth a watch, just be aware of what you're getting into."
Unbelievable,1,Toni Collette and Merritt Wever make a formidable team of detectives.
Peacemaker,1,"Yet again, James Gunn delivers big on the irreverent humor while managing to infuse the story with a significant amount of heart and purpose. And as an added bonus, Peacemaker comes with unskippable and highly rewatchable opening credits."
Love Life,1,"William Jackson Harper carries the series into richer terrain, exploring universal themes of seeking love mingled with the Black American experience."
Atlanta,1,"Although it isn't set in Atlanta (Amsterdam gets the honors), this season is very Atlanta. Keenly insightful, brutally honest and often painfully accurate."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"The season premiere, surprisingly, is directed by Lucy Liu. But [the first two] episodes seemed a bit underwhelming."
Dark,1,It's here where a show that's always delighted in complexity finally explodes.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Not every episode hits the mark in The Boys Presents: Diabolical, but there are enough gloriously twisted ideas in this brutal, bloody, and surprisingly thought-provoking anthology series to make it essential viewing for fans of The Boys."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider works. Like any good King adapter, Price hews close to King's original plot while relying on his own strengths to give the world an evocative visual palette and characters that feel truly alive within it."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"A great theme, gorgeous title sequence and some of the most patronising tales Star Trek has ever managed - it's no contest, Voyager is a dud."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is interested in a hyperrealistic take on an autocratic society, where change is slowly and painfully chipped at from within. Its heroes aren't glamorous revolutionaries, but tweedy bureaucrats and scientists."
The Night Of,1,Zaillian and Price's series paints a disturbing picture of the criminal justice system-and how its intrinsic financial and psychological pressures tear away at one's soul.
Cheers,1,"Refusing to preach, ""Cheers"" offered a kind of refuge from contemporary upheavals and anxieties, not totally ignoring them, but also not letting them interfere with the nonstop flow of jokes."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Might make some parents smile... My 7-year-old son has already asked to re-watch the second episode of Prodigy so this latest ""Trek"" is certainly well-calibrated to capture the interest of its target audience."
And Just Like That...,1,"I have to admit to plenty of laughs, and a comfort in the reunion of old friends. Prepare to giggle, cry, and cringe a lot."
Shameless,0,"After months of delays, Shameless is back and more uneven than ever... Narratively speaking, there was no direction. A show in its final season should have set up conflicts that need to be resolved by the time the series finale arrives."
Outer Range,1,"In less capable hands this could have easily made for a frustrating, impatient experience, but there’s something hauntingly hypnotic about Outer Range that demands you stay with it, even when its hold over you slackens."
The White Lotus,1,"Dreadful rich people make for brilliant TV, but it is rare to see their privileges and prejudices skewered with such relentless precision. White's characters can be monstrous, but they are so carefully wrought that they also feel painfully human."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"With explosive, intense action sequences, fascinating character work, and nuanced performances from its lead cast, Daredevil Season 3 is absolutely a return to form - and that goes for both the show itself and the Netflix corner of the MCU as a whole."
The Mist,0,It's a shame the potential of King's classic story is squandered on an uninspired script and bland performances.
MacGruber,1,"The cast - Forte and Wiig, in particular - completely commit themselves to the absurdity of it, and therein lies the remaining joy of MacGruber: Watching great comedic actors abandon their dignity in service of a laugh."
The Night Of,1,"The chaotic courtrooms, the lawless prisons, the overworked public servants are all victims of corrupt organisations. This isn't TV. This isn't HBO. The Night Of is the real deal."
The Staircase,1,"This three-tiered telling of ""The Staircase"" -- which builds, step by methodical step, on what transpired before -- is an extremely shrewd demonstration of getting maximum bang for its bucks."
The First,0,By the time the astronauts do get into space it doesn't feel like a triumph for mankind at all. It feels like what should have happened six episodes ago.
Mindhunter,1,The long-awaited second season of David Fincher's Mindhunter affirms the program as Netflix's strongest drama.
Rome,0,Lacks the strong perspective of a passionate author with ideas and angles and a story to tell.
Shadow and Bone,1,"Perfectly competent, enjoyable stuff. But, like The Witcher and the other contenders for the Thrones' crown that there have been since, it doesn't - or can't, whether for merely budgetary or more creative constraints - build on what has gone before."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World is all flash and no substance. It looks good but that's about as far as it goes. It isn't really interested in getting too deep into how the world operates because that's not where its priorities lie.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"It's a make-up story following an ugly breakup, interwoven into a dark, sinuous television universe that has continuously emulated our own, corrupt society so effortlessly."
Monk,0,"So, in its final season, Monk stays close to the formula that made it successful, offering more of the same."
Silicon Valley,1,"There's a fresh set of ethical dilemmas at the core of this final batch of episodes, as our nerdy heroes get close to a billion dollars but wonder at what cost: a fitting finale to one of HBO's smaller yet highly relevant shows."
Fargo,1,. It feels like Hawley is going less for the quirky black humor of the first three seasons and more for the tone of what was seen in the Coen's early serious films.
Shadow and Bone,1,"Some elements are overly familiar and others overly confusing, but Shadow And Bone will draw you into the Fold with its absorbing world-building and engaging lead duo."
Outer Range,1,"An economy of dialogue and a protraction of plot serve Outer Range well, as the mystery of the big spooky hole in the Abbotts’ west pasture isn’t the point of the series so much as its psychological fulcrum."
Coyote,1,"Michael Chiklis gets his biggest role since The Shield in this impressive cross-border crime drama, and he tears into it with great gusto and versatility."
Veep,1,"They may as well rename the Best Lead Actress in a Comedy the Julia Louis-Dreyfus Award. She was stunning, and the writing on this series - led by showrunner David Mandel - was next-world amazing."
Pieces of Her,1,Netflix's Pieces of Her delivers a very watchable by-the-numbers thriller that's strengthened by leading ladies Toni Collette and Bella Heathcote's dynamic chemistry.
Shadow and Bone,0,"Again and again, Shadow and Bone forces unearned story beats and melodrama. Its character-building is lackluster; its worldbuilding is mostly incoherent, and its script careens from one-liner to one-liner without much substance in between."
The Fall,1,The atmosphere is stiflingly tense.
Shadow and Bone,1,"While it lacks certain fantasy elements, Shadow and Bone more than makes up for it in expansive world-building and engaging characters"
Squid Game,1,"Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, who spent a decade trying to get the project green-lit and was once so desperate he sold his laptop for cash, will probably have less trouble getting his next script financed."
The White Lotus,1,"The generosity with which he watches these folks he's loosed upon us, in this little island on an island in the middle of a glittering sea astride the somewhere-out-there specter of an invisible pandemic, it's what art exists for."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Every performance here works, which is a great credit to Zobel for tying these characters together in a way that makes the supporting players seem like actual locals with full lives."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"The collection of nine episodes is the Star Wars we all know and love, but one that grants a refreshing new experience to viewers like myself, who are looking for something different."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"After a terrible first season that swung wildly and lamely, a deeply revamped Marvel's Iron Fist... finally packs a real punch."
Evil,1,"Kristen is the best antihero on television, somewhere between audience surrogate and actual demon, impossible to track and thrilling to watch."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Jonathan Majors is phenomenal as the brooding Tic, backed effectively by Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Letitia and Courtney B Vance as George."
Loot,1,"With a stellar cast, Loot is electrically hilarious. It’s fun, introspective, and hits all the right notes. The series manages to take the workplace comedy, twist it, and come out the other side with something unique..."
Limitless,1,The producers here may have finally cracked the McDorman code.
Normal People,1,"Normal People ask a lot of [its leads], not just in the honest wrenching conversations they share, but also loads of on-screen sex. It's very, very intimate."
Casual,1,"""Casual"" packs an extraordinary amount of plot and wit into each half-hour episode."
Limitless,1,"The series begins with a familiar mix of FBI procedural and cheeky class clown comedy but the series gets more clever with the humor in later episodes, goofing on Brian's narration and playing games with shifting perspectives..."
Defending Jacob,1,It may be a slow burn but there are reasons enough to keep going.
The Americans,1,There's a certain amount of pride watching the unfolding of this last season of The Americans. There are a lot of plates spinning -- it's time to see which are saved and which are shattered.
The Morning Show,0,"Without the storyline that gave The Morning Show all its power and nuance, we are left with the old luxury fluff, reacquainting ourselves with characters who aren't substantial enough to merely hang out with."
The Wilds,1,"Overall, the second season, while not as incredible as the first, is still great, albeit quick, watch. The ending of the season, which provides answers but poses many more questions, is incredible and turns up the heat on the entire series."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Shobu Kapoor and Madhav Sharma aren't series regulars, but manage to steal every scene they're in as Amina's supportive parents."
Legion,1,Legion's third season premiere is as quirky and whimsical as you want it to be.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"In addition to fresh, sharp writing, the casting in Freaks and Geeks is exceptional. This is one of the few high-school shows in which the actors actually look like they could be in high school."
Top Boy,1,When Ashley Walters’ Dushane growls ‘we got a problem’ you know he means serious business.
Ozark,1,"Be it the thrills, the performances, or morbid curiosity, Mundy's series is still searching for more meaning in its final hours."
Ozark,1,These seven episodes are more about saying goodbye than good riddance–a staggering tonal shift for a show so dark it once threatened to drown a baby.
Sharp Objects,1,"While the storyline contains familiar (not to say overused) crime-story tropes, Sharp Objects succeeds as a mood piece."
Shining Girls,1,"Between the high-concept premise, some great direction from Breaking Bad alum Michelle MacLaren, and the usual superhuman intensity from Elisabeth Moss in the lead role, the series transcends a lot of the usual clichés and pitfalls."
His Dark Materials,1,"Thematically darkness and light are perfectly balanced as Jack Thorne shares conversations, shapes character dynamics and tees up emotional pay offs."
After Life,1,"Ultimately, it's worth sticking with, but you can't help feeling it would have worked better as a single 90-minute special."
The Sopranos,1,"It felt more violent, more disturbing, more unfair than even the most savage murders Chase has depicted over the course of six seasons, because the victim was us. He ended the series by whacking the viewer."
The Stranger,0,"'The Stranger' might hold some kind of interest to fans of Harlan Coben's work and are desperate to see it adapted to screen, but really, there's far better on offer than just this."
Central Park,1,"Out of a park, Bouchard has built a universe. It’s a rare thing in TV. Sitcoms in the US are almost always about the three spheres of American life: work, school, and home."
Just Beyond,1,"Stine helped craft the storylines for each episode, which means his unique magic touch can be felt in every episode."
The Wheel of Time,1,"This is not Game of Thrones, it's a warm hug of fantasy tropes, running gags and special effects. It will likely do very well, because those who adore it will watch it again and again."
Lovecraft Country,1,"A pulpy, smart, and compelling series, ""Lovecraft Country"" expertly tackles race issues while incorporating slick special effects, folklore, and stellar performances. It's all you'll be talking for the rest of the summer. The best show of 2020 so far."
Chernobyl,1,"While the first two episodes have been incredibly heavy, they have also been an exercise in stellar filmmaking and performing."
Stranger Things,1,I cannot wait to see how things shake out with the Hawkins gang when the series returns in July. I just wish we didn’t have to sit through even longer episodes with the rest of the stories to get there.
The Crown,1,There's no fairy tale here; only a real-life soap opera plotline that played out in front of billions. That's part of the reason why this season works so well.
Weeds,0,"The show had been through so many time jumps and location changes, it was hard to know which state or decade we were supposed to be in, and even harder to care."
The Affair,1,"No TV series has dropped the viewer in the middle of narrative discord quite so effectively, as each hour split its perspective among different characters."
Arrested Development,0,"Limping badly out of the gate, the new season is disappointingly lackluster, often awkward, oddly paced... and I just didn't laugh all that much."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Its fantastical elements, surprisingly hard-hitting violence, and committed performances keep this Wheel turning enough to earn satisfaction from genre-appreciative audiences."
Rise,1,[The show] does a nice job of showing the world just how important the arts are to children.
Adventure Time,1,It was weird and sad and silly and funny and harrowing and so quietly profound I'll be thinking about it probably forever.
Loki,1,"It's a strange episode of television, even borderline absurdist, but of course, as things get interesting, it has to do some MCU homework that grind things to a halt."
Prison Break,0,"Prison Break isn't worth much of anything, but it could have been. You can see the better show trying to escape its lock-up of bad ideas."
Brave New World,0,"There is nothing particularly brave, new, or urgent about this monotonous sex, drugs, and caste system saturated vision of a future New London."
Hannibal,1,"Thanks to some sharp dialogue pleated with myriad meanings, Mikkelsen and Anderson enthrall just as much as the show's usual histrionic, CGI-addled murder-as-performance-art setpieces."
Fleabag,1,"The comedy, which unfolds in six delightfully perfect installments, remains as sharp and as witty as ever."
WandaVision,1,Magnetic... a great metaphor for how a series seeks to forever modify the consumption of superheroes on TV today. [Full review in Spanish]
Banshee,1,It isn't long though before you start remembering how much you enjoy these characters
Breaking Bad,1,This is the end that Breaking Bad deserved. [Full Review in Spanish]
Death Note,1,This cat-and-mouse series is highly addictive.
Normal People,1,The transporting power of literature is transplanted here to a charming television drama that imbues that story framework with all the powerful benefits of performance and visual storytelling. It's the best of both worlds.
11.22.63,1,"The net effect is ultimately intoxicating if you accept that the digressions are the point of the story, and are in fact inevitable given the sort of person Jake is."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Why must Sam, or anyone for that matter, don a nation's name and symbols in order to be a fitting hero? The show never provides a satisfactory answer."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Paired with a lively cast and a handsome production fit for his vivid adventures, the new series is as silly and smart as we’ve come to expect from Waititi’s productions."
Loot,1,Rodriguez brings the same heartfelt emotion to Sofia that made her the most likable character on FX’s Pose and her chemistry with Rudolph proves magnetic. It’s the most unexpected but welcome odd-couple pairing of the summer TV season so far.
The Crown,1,"The Crown is also at its best when it explores the economic and political crises throughout our country's history, which it does a lot in this series."
Brave New World,1,"Brown Findlay and Lloyd are likeable leads, and we root for them even though they are explicitly lacking in emotion."
Covert Affairs,1,"This season of Covert Affairs is going to be the first one without a Henry Wilcox storyline, and I couldn't be happier."
The Outsider,1,"Adapted by The Wire writer Richard Price, HBO's The Outsider is the ultimate tale of otherworldly nightmares creeping into our existence."
Lucifer,1,"Though it was touch-and-go there for a couple seasons as we wondered how Lucifer would end, the show managed to give us exactly the kind of sendoff we-and these characters-deserved."
WandaVision,1,It's brilliant once you've thought it over. These allusions to classic comfort food TV make us believe someone's mind might be breaking... But who? Where exactly are they? And why does all this quirky perfection make us so uncomfortable?
The Nevers,1,"This period drama about the persecution - and power - of the marginalized goes wide on genre appeal, while homing in on painfully contemporary themes. And it's full of riddles designed to keep us hooked."
What If...?,1,"If you enjoyed the colourful chaos of the magnificent Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, then you'll absolutely fall in love with Disney+'s latest Marvel series."
Loot,1,"The further the show goes on, the richer Molly, her support ensemble and her story seem to get."
How to Get Away With Murder,1,"It wouldn't be a shocking conclusion to see Annalise die by the series finale, but a closed casket and no sightings of any of her ""people"" has my interest piqued."
Calls,1,"Asking viewers to suspend their existing notions of all these concepts as they watch to the stories play out is what makes a show like Calls so deliciously engaging - if, and it's a big, important if, you can get past the quirks of the format."
Mad Men,1,"In any case, I ate this episode up, from the realistically tender state of Don's marriage onward. This show may be a timepiece. But it's also, for better or worse, a conversation piece."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Ambitious family drama-meets-horror story is dark, mature."
This Way Up,0,"While the show balances its many themes and characters well, in the end, it feels a bit rushed."
Mr. Corman,1,It's one of the best depictions of listless thirtysomething manhood I've seen in ages.
WandaVision,1,An enjoyable episode overall.
True Detective,1,"Ali isn't in every scene in True Detective; it just seems like it. The show is Ali's masterpiece, and the third season is the best installment since it premiered five years ago to excessive praise."
1883,1,"If they don't mind the Stetson-wearing testosterone, then it's a wagon trail that will prove entertaining enough to follow."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"There is, the wandering plot notwithstanding, plenty of reason to relish the antic tone, the way the aimless banter and the flashes of wit manage to instill life into otherwise feeble exchanges."
Harlots,1,"A thrilling, brainy bodice-ripper that combines the epic wordplay of Shakespeare, the ruthless political survivalism of Machiavelli and the gutting sentimentality of Mario Puzo."
The Outsider,1,"Hopefully, The Outsider's Fincher-flavoured intensity and sharp acting performances will prove a winning combination for viewers."
Shining Girls,1,"It’s further proof that when it comes to audience buy-in, whether the story is seemingly conventional or dauntingly out-there, having Moss at the top of the call sheet is as close to a guarantee as you’re ever going to get."
Station Eleven,1,"Grace, hope, and encouragement are foundational elements of ""Station Eleven"" that help turn what could've been a very bad idea into a profoundly cathartic experience."
Just Beyond,0,Not at all memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"What's left is to watch the fireworks as Chastain and Isaac immolate one another, and those are indeed spectacular. But sitting through five hours of rage -- that's a big ask."
Watchmen,1,"The show is so ambitious, with its multiple timelines, storytelling structures, and perspectives, that it's perpetually surprising."
Community,1,"These episodes are not their finest half-hours, but they're laying a foundation for greater things to come."
Severance,1,Benefits from rich world-building and droll humor about office perks and morale.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere has issues, but it's a very watchable show that should be buoyed by Witherspoon's and Washington's performances."
Under the Dome,1,"As far as answers go, we may not have gotten the full monty, but an effort was made to drive us toward (hopefully) the endgame."
Hawkeye,0,"Hailee Steinfeld shines, but the rest is forgettable. It says a lot that the Avengers musical, a show within the show, is currently the best thing about this show."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Parts of this were featured in the 1970 doc, but not in this way and with this much authenticity. It's pure electricity."
For All Mankind,1,"The third season of the alt-history series reinforces that 'For All Mankind' is not just an entertaining drama, but a truly great one..."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Sailing from History channel to Netflix, Vikings: Valhalla should be an even bigger attraction, charting a new chapter set more than a century after the original, while offering most of the same lusty charms."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"The brilliance of this show is that you want to solve the mystery as if it were a thriller, but you get all the pleasure of it being a comedy, too."
The Mandalorian,1,"It's no small feat to create a character who is well-rounded and sympathetic, while mostly hidden behind an expressionless mask. But all the credit goes to Pascal for imbuing the man, also known as Din Djarin, with layers of ever-present depth."
The Americans,1,The Americans is full of great musical notes that carry complexity beyond pure sonic pleasure. But it's also just-plain fun sometimes.
Barry,1,"It’s one of the most meaningful, and complicated, uses of dark comedy on television. It’s also hard to tell whether the dark or the comedy will win in the end, but that’s what keeps us watching."
The Offer,1,With 10 hour episodes this series is a gigantic undertaking and we’re seeing the emerging problems the script has in following three distinct story lines that all have to mesh.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"This isn’t a game-changing drama, but it’s an absurdly entertaining one."
Boardwalk Empire,0,It's too late to try to make Nucky a compelling character after so many false starts over the past four seasons.
The Outsider,1,The story's remorselessly tightening grip is underpinned by the way the unfolding weirdness is kept firmly anchored in daily lives and humdrum detail.
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"On the whole, the interplay between these distinctions and dichotomies provides more than enough reason to give this series a chance."
The Undoing,0,The murder case wends its way to trial while more revelations come to light. By the fifth episode the story feels fully spent and too thinly stretched. Beauty and mood can take things only so far.
And Just Like That...,1,"And Just Like That tries too hard to bring its cultural brand into a new era, but it reclaims a core humanity lacking in the previous franchise extensions."
The Twilight Zone,1,Some of the absolute best episodes of The Twilight Zone explore the stigmas and fears around mental illness-namely the paranoid feeling that no one around them will believe them.
Loki,1,"The approach is bold, the pacing is brisk, and the mix of humor within the narrative is perfectly balanced."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Season Four, broadcast in two chunks with a climbing-the-wall break due to the writers' strike, proved the most challenging, soul-searching and devastatingly turbulent yet."
Fargo,0,"Too often, though, the narrative moves at a crawl, filled with long conversations that carry the impending threat of violence."
And Just Like That...,0,"As a cultural moment, the story of Carrie & Friends is perhaps best left in the past. Dragging it into the present can only offer diminishing returns."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu's adaptation is a resounding disappointment, considering the star power behind it - a flat, formulaic melodrama that hits all the wrong notes."
Marvel's Runaways,0,"It's as though Runaways knows it should be a show about the instability and intensity of being a teenager, but lacks the courage to engage with those stakes."
The Gilded Age,1,"Some of the characters seem as if they are there to prove points about the social situations, and feel generic at times. All that said, The Gilded Age is still a lot of fun."
Ramy,1,"Throughout the 30-minute format provides enough time to get the story told without lollygagging...""Ramy"" will jump from one scene to the next almost before you can get the laugh out. Yet it rarely seems hurried."
Foundation,1,"The two other most compelling characters are easily those played by Lee Pace and Jared Harris. Whenever these two actors are giving elaborate speeches or chewing the scenery, Foundation soars to its epic science-fiction heights."
The Crown,1,The Crown season 4 is the best season yet of the Netflix royal drama and boasts added momentum and marvellous performances with the additions of Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher and newcomer Emma Corrin as Princess Diana.
Pachinko,1,"A story that intertwines themes of love, loyalty, and faithfulness (or not) to traditions. [Full review in Spanish]"
Mr. Robot,1,"Despite its regular references to classic paranoid thrillers, it's not nearly as pessimistic as we might've thought based on Malek's hard-boiled and spiritually exhausted narration."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Despite the on-the-nose elements of the show's pandemic portrayal, Sweet Tooth is a series worth your time and emotional energy."
Mad Men,1,The equivalence of Don and Freddy is actually far more pronounced than previously imagined.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"A sublime little seven-episode sitter, with no room for sequels, which throughout managed to be tense without melodramatic, yearning without cloying, popular without pandering."
Chappelle's Show,0,Comedy Central made a huge mistake in airing unfinished (and mediocre) skits left behind when Chappelle bailed on the network two years ago. That's not to say I can't understand its motivation.
Castle Rock,1,"Whether you love or could leave the rest of Castle Rock, know this: Lizzy Caplan will blow you away."
Scandal,1,Scandal was more than its wildest plot twists or Olivia's white hat. It was a very real hit that changed the TV industry in more ways than one.
Taboo,0,"All of the show's brooding and scheming goes nowhere, and the macho posturing of the various characters wears out its welcome pretty quickly."
Starstruck,1,"Matafeo is endlessly watchable, her timing and delivery pure alchemy, and Sidi is fantastic. Even the side roles work hard."
Supernatural,1,"Sam and Dean have matured and evolved along with the people watching them, and their separate journeys speak to the darkness hunkered down within each of us and our wider culture."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"In its favor it is beautifully made, tonally distinct and exceptionally well-acted. It is gripping and slightly sinister from almost the start and fueled by an off-kilter erotic charge."
The Wire,1,"It is as if, in a guilty fever, we dreamt up our own worst punishments-stories of the sort Joan Didion used to tell us about the princess caged in the consulate and the man with the candy leading the children into the sea."
Invincible,1,"One of the best things about Invincible, though, is its stellar voice performances. While a lot of major characters get a chance to shine in the first three episodes, Steven Yeun's turn as Mark Grayson is particularly noteworthy."
The Staircase,1,"Don’t be afraid of this dramatization of your baby, true crime fans. The Staircase is in good hands."
Peaky Blinders,1,"It’s all here. The violence, yes, but also the flat caps, the undercut hairdos that have become inexplicably popular, the Birmingham burr, the contemporary music, the slo-mo, the gloomy oppressiveness."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Their music brings back rushes of nostalgia and admiration, but the best thing is - here they are, four young men at their peaks of creativity as one, fresh, young, mop-topped and engaged with one another."
Succession,1,The strong cast... all have an offhanded way of delivering their barbs that is as naturalistic as it is rollicking.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Fittingly switching between sweetness and bite, Sweet Tooth is a children's fable fit for grown-ups."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The plot gets going and Winslet makes the most of a role that in lesser hands could be a collection of tropes (in episode two, grouchy Mare is paired with a hotshot young detective brought in from out-of-town)."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"For as much as the general love for Trek permeates this show, Lower Decks really has begun to come into its own with its own characters and its own unique spin on what makes a story work in this particular vision for the 24th century."
The Shrink Next Door,0,This is a staggeringly huge misfire.
Barry,1,"Season three of Barry three slides into another stratosphere: it's that blisteringly clever, deeply layered, piercingly moving and terrifically acted."
Succession,1,"While this was certainly an entertaining season, it feels like things are in the same place they were in season one. Things need to start happening in order to keep viewers entertained."
The Wonder Years,1,"The new Wonder Years has moments of absolute joy and levity, but it also proves that history continues to scream at us from the past."
Stranger Things,1,"Not only has our young cast grown up, but so too has the series, bringing along a richer story, a genuine sense of foreboding and a chance for the cast and its characters to develop further."
The Staircase,1,It makes for very powerful TV.
Star Trek: Discovery,0,"It feels like a rehash from the jump, but perhaps it will go somewhere different."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"[The] second season may or may not repeat that feat, but it sure packs a lot more punch."
Severance,1,"A work of terrific imagination and confidence: THX-1138, Brazil, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying swirled together into a deranged sweet-and-savory concoction."
Better Things,1,"Its finally time to say goodbye, and what a sendoff it is."
Yellowjackets,1,Lord of the Flies is probably the best metaphor we've got for what happens when society breaks down and humans return to our most primal urges. Yellowjackets takes that concept in a particularly dark direction.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Mike Flanagan really knows how to play with the audience and deliver scares with a great story.
The Expanse,1,"In [numerous] respects, Season 6 of The Expanse is as consistent, thrilling, and entertaining as the five seasons that preceded it."
The O.C.,1,"Television as Schadenfreude. These people might wallow in wealth, have fabulous clothes and live in ever-sunny California but they still suffered. On a daily basis. Usually because of their own stupid decisions. You just can't beat escapist TV that."
Love Life,1,"I started watching the new season last week and, the more I watched, the more I got reeled [in]."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"Its four-episode counts makes it an easy investment, one whose ultimate turn is bizarre but feels like a perfect fit for this strange case's natural twists."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The new episodes share many of the original batch's most effective elements -- strong performances, deft retro soundtrack choices (leaning more on folk this time), a blend of humor and pathos -- without ever finding a reason to exist."
Devs,1,Devs successfully allocates all of its storytelling devices to communicate the deeper questions of humanity and its place in the universe.
Unbelievable,1,"What sets Unbelievable apart from a show like Mindhunter is that it is, first and foremost, from the perspective of the victims and their female counterparts working against a predominantly male system of indifference."
The Staircase,1,"As Michael Peterson, Colin Firth manages to make us think he’s guilty as hell one minute, and possibly innocent the next. Toni Collette is touching as Kathleen."
The Gilded Age,1,"""Erudite, elegant period drama in which 'old' money is suddenly confronted by 'new', threatening New York's aristocratic social hierarchy."""
Cheers,1,"The show ended sentimentally but without sappiness. Love was mentioned and so were shoes. It was, simply, perfect."
Lovecraft Country,1,"A show that uses genre storytelling to peel back layers of American history to reveal the systemic problems underneath it, but it's also got a marvelously entertaining side, one that's gory and sexy in unexpected ways."
The Undoing,1,"Kidman is the mistress of vulpine consternation, and her bohemian wardrobe, all droopy textured coats and flowing dresses, looks like a leftover from when she played Virginia Woolf."
The Staircase,1,"It is a tragedy of epic proportions, sprawled out over 15 years. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. The case drags on. Yet Kathleen Peterson remains dead, reduced to a series of graphic images, to pieces of bloody evidence."
Watchmen,1,"Fans of Moore's book will not be disappointed, while a new generation not familiar with its characters or the story should be inspired too."
1883,1,"We're concerned about the pacing of 1883 and how it depicts Indigenous people, but the story is compelling, and Sam Elliott's multi-layered lead performance is more than enough to keep us interested."
The Wheel of Time,0,"From what I understand, longtime fans of the books have felt underwhelmed and badly served by some changes in characterizations, and the aging up of the main players."
Heartstopper,1,"his is a sweet and endearing story of ""boy meets boy"", as they try to cope with the struggles of their own sexualities, first love, and GCSEs."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,A great show that hooks on the quirky adventures of Clone Force 99. [Full Review in Spanish]
Little Fires Everywhere,1,It's written and directed with a sure touch.
The Man in the High Castle,1,"The series has a good starting point, makes unconvincing turns, but have good characters, on the edge of good and evil. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Mosquito Coast,1,"It's pretty well put together, at least to begin."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Like any paperback novel you’d pick up at an airport newsstand, Netflix’s Anatomy of a Scandal isn’t for all time, but it does make for a good time."
The Staircase,1,"Michael and Kathleen are played by Colin Firth and Toni Collette, respectively, two well-distinguished actors who shine brightly and play well off of each other."
The Act,1,"The scripts by Dean and Antosca and the performances by the two leads do a fine job exploring the murky power dynamic between mother and child... Both actors are terrific, but King is more likely the one people will be talking about after."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Sheridan is in his element when it comes to creating male characters with a tendency towards sudden, shocking violence. Subtlety is not his forte -- but, even so, his concerns about private prisons are likely to slide past most of the red-state viewers."
MacGruber,1,"The action may be bigger, and the jokes slightly more ridiculous, but that's to be expected in MacGruber's biggest story yet."
Search Party,1,"The fifth and final season of Search Party is, frankly, bananas. It takes a ridiculous, ballsy, massive swerve, keeping the same familiar characters but plunging them into a quasi-alt-universe version of the Brooklyn they had previously inhabited."
Bel-Air,1,"The main Banks making the series work is Jabari, the newcomer playing the fictional Will Smith. He has a lively swagger that emerges more readily as the series goes on."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable's unique take on cop dramas and amazing performances makes it worth it.
The Defiant Ones,1,"Music fans looking for a stylishly made documentary that celebrates two influential record producers, and overflows with rock, hip hop, and pop superstars, should find The Defiant Ones breezy summer viewing."
Lovecraft Country,1,To say that Lovecraft Country is a whole lot of show would be an understatement.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"From the performances to the directing to the fight choreography, every nut and bolt of this narrative has been tightened down."
Peaky Blinders,1,Peaky Blinders is a resounding victory for style over substance.
Stranger Things,1,The new terror is one of the most horrifying creations yet from show creators and writers Matt and Ross Duffer. …this season features some of the most gore-infused moments to date.
The Righteous Gemstones,1,A clever nine-episode sophomore outing that's sharply written and often very funny.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Marvelous adult ensemble and cast of diverse talented children are a delight. First half of season is charming, with story of very smart kids, but adult problems get nasty."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"I for one, wish more of television would take the leap that is Agent Carter. At this point, I'm following her wherever she goes."
Irma Vep,1,“Irma Vep” is a delightfully self-reflexive ode to the heartbreak of making and loving movies — or streaming television in the 2020s.
Save Me,1,"Save Me Too digs deeper and takes even those familiar with series one on a journey they won't be expecting - satisfying yet surprising, it's sure to have its loyal audience hooked all over again."
Yellowjackets,1,"Many of its influences already overlap, and thus work together well. The ones that don't can at times combine to create something that feels new and potent, but at others make it feel like the stew could have done with fewer ingredients."
Calls,1,"If you're a fan of mind-benders (and Calls is inherently mind-bending, as from the start it asks you to deprioritise the sense of sight) then you're in for a treat."
Watchmen,1,Lindelof... leaves [viewers] surprised and wanting more. [Full review in Spanish]
Line of Duty,0,"There is great potential here but last night's episode was at times impenetrable, as if taking our loyalties for granted. If I had been watching for the first time I might have switched off."
Station Eleven,1,"It's an intelligent, genre-bending piece with a hint of the uncanny. Well worth checking out."
Detroiters,1,"Detroiters so easily could've been an insular half hour of bro-ey inside jokes, or worse, a Portlandia for the Motor City. Instead, it's a colorful world of dippy, hysterical characters that you want to spend time with. It's joy-inducing stuff."
Game of Thrones,1,"Season 8 is the weakest, but it's still good. It's just ""Good"" in amongst a series that constantly hit ""Excellent"" makes it really stand out..."
Person of Interest,1,"The implication is clear: If we survive the coming AI war, it won't be because we've placated either superintelligence; it will be because we've remembered what makes us human in the first place."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"A funny thing happens mid-season here, in that what begins as truly laugh out loud hilarious turns into a far more serious, introspective dramatic whodunit."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,[Iron Fist] fails to punch through in satisfying ways and ends up being another middling entry in what has been a disappointing year for sophomore runs in the Marvel universe on TV.
BoJack Horseman,1,The show is as funny and surprising as it always was.
Peacemaker,1,"Cena, who is making his case for the next pro wrestler-turned-A-lister action star, harnesses an effective push-and-pull as a moron who is beginning to see the light."
Better Call Saul,1,"While its choices may fall under new scrutiny once the seasons over, this episode is a staggering achievement, giving one character the showcase he deserves before the fate he cant outrun arrives."
Big Little Lies,0,"A lot feels unrealistic here. Celeste is in therapy, but her kids, who are fighting all the time, are not. And characters drop lines that underline their every feeling, as if the audience wouldn't get it otherwise."
Devs,0,It's interesting but wordy and perhaps better suited to film than TV considering the verbiage and slow pace.
Parenthood,1,"The Bravermans left their mark on us in a way not many families do -- especially on TV -- and for that we'll be forever grateful, even through our tearful goodbye."
Visible: Out on Television,1,Visible is vital viewing for where we were and where we are.
Fleabag,1,What Waller-Bridge does with a familiar British comedy trope is explosive.
The Night Of,1,"It is a workman-like whodunit (or, more apt, a did-he-really-do-it?) and a somber meditation on the hellishness of the slow-grinding bureaucracy of the criminal justice system."
The Outsider,0,To have a work of ostensible horror that keeps undermining the ideas and conventions of the genre feels like an odd kind of compromise.
Big Little Lies,1,"That first season was perfect television and this second season, while promising, already lacks the kind of stakes that existed in the first. But we shall see."
Hacks,1,"While Hacks Season 2 struggles a bit to keep those plates in the air at first, it's still as cutting and engaging as ever, building steam throughout."
The First,1,"It's not what I thought it was going to be... But it moved and impressed me to the point where I didn't particularly care if a given scene or story line was ""working"" or not It has a pioneering spirit."
The Gilded Age,1,"Another fantastic confection from Downton Abbey's Julian Fellowes - but distinctly American. Also much more history is included. Coon, Spector & Benton are the stand-outs."
Mare of Easttown,1,"All of this rich backstory and careful character detail significantly enhances the girl-murdered-in-a-small-town TV series template, already well explored by Sharp Objects and Top of the Lake."
What If...?,0,"Each episode may begin with What If...?, but they end, resoundingly, with nothing more than ""So what?"""
WandaVision,1,The first three episodes are all set up with a ton of metatext on sitcoms with two underserved Avengers. Not enough to judge yet.
Chernobyl,1,OK. I cried. But that wouldn't stop me from watching it all again because it is a story that needs to be told in the very dramatic fashion that five hours of Chernobyl allows.
Turner & Hooch,1,"While paying respectful homage to the original film and beautifully continuing its legacy (it's) not afraid to forge its own path. Plenty of laughs, great action set pieces and great characters make for an enjoyable buddy-cop series for all!"
Prison Break,0,"My hope is that this will satisfy whatever itch the show's die-hards had to elicit this revival, if only to finally put an end to all of this."
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal remains a show that flirts dangerously with being very silly, however it struts about with such devil-may-care panache that it gets away with pretty much everything it wants to."
You,1,"I love the sardonic tone and bluntness of the storytelling. Love's recklessness does become a point of contention, though."
Devs,1,"If you're into sci-fi, and into Garland (and the latter kind of follows the former naturally), you'll be into Devs."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Whether Sweet Tooth can travel the same surprise path to stardom remains to be seen, but it's at least nice to have a new show worth following as we enter another summer..."
We Are Lady Parts,1,Delightful... a bright and brash look at a culture entirely written and directed by Nina Manzoor.
30 Rock,1,"I'm genuinely sad to lose my Thursdays with this awesomely dense comedy, which amounted to a grenade made of zingers."
And Just Like That...,0,"Hopefully, we can get to a place where the angst-ridden characters spent a little less time lamenting their place in the cosmos, and more time ordering cosmos."
Mythic Quest,1,"I've never been a fan of video games, but I'm sold on the sardonic silliness of Mythic Quest."
Mindhunter,1,"From the little I've seen, the high standards of season 1 haven't dipped a bit."
Fargo,0,"While Hawley's effort is admirable, and the performances from the cast keep the show at least watchable, most of what happens throughout the season, unfortunately, feels monotone."
Homeland,0,"The finish wasn't entirely convincing, and while it provided a degree of closure, didn't loop back to the show's origins as deftly as one might have hoped."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable isn't a programme about whether Adler was telling the truth. It's about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"At just eight episodes, it doesn't demand a huge commitment, and while it's highly bingeable, it has plenty of real substance, too. Each episode ends so enticingly poised that it's hard not to let the next one play."
Loki,1,"Clever, bold and flat out fascinating, ""Loki"" sets a new bar for Disney+ shows."
Hacks,1,"The lack of epiphanies, life lessons, and intergenerational bonding is what makes the second season work so well. The show isn’t following the trajectory of other comedies that have forced their characters to hit the road."
Prison Break,0,"The question remains: Other than an effort to goose ratings with the return of a familiar title, is there really any creative reason for more Prison Break? Probably not."
Marvel's Runaways,0,Their lazy symbolism made the show a miss for me.
A Teacher,0,I can't help thinking A Teacher might have imparted its lesson better if it weren't quite so enraptured of the affair too.
We Own This City,1,"Highly, heavily recommended."
Russian Doll,1,"Its exploration of how fruitless ""what if"" thinking is and the importance of taking agency in your own life despite your generational baggage builds wonderfully on the themes explored in the first season."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"""Star Wars: Visions"" ain't canon, it's heart."
Midnight Mass,1,"Occasionally the monologues go on a little long, but the rich and complicated analysis of faith and religion, the stellar cast, the great direction and amazing creature design all make this one of Flanagan's best works to date"
Chuck,1,"Still, despite its flaws, it's nice to have a farewell romp with Chuck, Sarah, Casey and Morgan before they leave us behind for good."
Unbelievable,1,"Amazing, enraging and utterly absorbing."
Sex and the City,1,"Sex proves it still has a sharp eye for the passing scene. BOTTOM LINE: Funny, but showing its age."
The Twilight Zone,0,"In a twist worthy of the show's creepy music, the original series speaks to the strange times through which we're living more directly and profoundly than the new one."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"Compared with the original, Wonderland boasts a more streamlined story (at least for now) that's built upon an easier-to-understand quest: Save the boy; go back home."
And Just Like That...,1,What was once 'sassy' is now 'somber.
Killing Eve,0,"It’s still recognisably Killing Eve and it’s still kinda cool, but it’s out of new ideas."
The Flight Attendant,1,"It’s still a delicious mix of pulse-pounding thrills, razor-sharp comedy and surprisingly meaty psychological drama."
Loki,1,"The first two episodes of Loki are extremely exciting and this has the potential to be the best of the MCU spin-off shows from 2021. Let's hope it continues to be weird, dystopian and gorgeous to look at."
30 Coins,1,"Imagine an R-rated, blood-soaked National Treasure directed by Guillermo del Toro, and you'll have some idea of what to expect coming into this daring and dramatic religious fantasy horror series."
WandaVision,1,"The action, emotions, and drama all make this a must-see show, and Wandavision has rightfully been praised for its strong themes related to grief, love, and family."
Alias Grace,1,"I defy anyone to end this series not a little in love with Gadon's Grace, be she murderess or not."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The footage has been meticulously restored; it looks and sounds like it was filmed yesterday. The result is uncanny. It feels like a dream, a magic trick, a work of time travel science fiction."
Station Eleven,1,"The ideal show for right now... a lyrical, heartfelt and character-driven apocalyptic musing with an immediate difference."
The Afterparty,1,"In concept and execution, it's impressively ambitious..."
Landscapers,1,"As a viewer, I very much enjoyed it, but if I was related to Patricia and William Wycherley, I would be furious."
Y: The Last Man,1,This show's genius is in the details. The little glances. Microexpressions. Unspoken exchanges. Nora batting a vase off a table like a cat.
Hacks,1,"While slightly less edgy and fierce than the first season, “Hacks” Season 2 really starts to find its footing again in the second half of the season – reminding us what a great combo Smart and Einbinder are"
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,Game Changers has the potential to be a Cobra Kai level legacy sequel.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"It's a relief to have the series back to pick up a strange, uneven TV season."
Watchmen,1,"It's dense, odd, thrilling and thoughtful, and it's much closer to Westworld's headspinning sci-fi complexity than the colourful comic book action of Marvel."
Swagger,1,"Swagger might have one manufactured conflict too many, but when it settles into the stories that come naturally from these kids dealing with an uncertain future, it shines."
Bridgerton,1,"While the hit drama has been known for its outlandish plots, soapy elements, and everything in between, the storytelling on Bridgerton Season 2 is far tighter than its predecessor."
Bridgerton,1,"While its not as raunchy as the first season, in many ways this season is more romantic and I dont think the returning audience (unless theyre maybe die-hard fans of the books) will be disappointed. Bailey is outstanding, as are the costumes."
Sex/Life,1,"Even as I was rolling my eyes at some of the insanely stupid actions of the lead characters and chuckling at the at-times overwrought score, I can't deny ""Sex/Life"" had a certain binge-worthy quality."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"With legal TV impresario David E. Kelley at the helm adapting a novel with a grabby MeToo-inspired premise, this drama should be spectacular, but it doesn't quite hit those heights."
Invincible,1,"Indeed, streaming is awash in such fare... That sense of familiarity doesn't necessarily undermine Invincible on its merits, but it does make the exercise unavoidably feel a bit been there, seen that."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"""After watching the nearly eight hours of this documentary, it's obvious that that image of the Beatles of that year was completely distorted, to say the least"". [Full Review in Spanish] -Letras Libres -"
Arrested Development,1,Season five is... not too bad. It is fine.
Station Eleven,1,"Once you get the rhythm, Station Eleven delivers a poignant exploration of the meaning of survival while asking us to imagine a better way to live."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,"""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is not only the best animated series of the last decade, but one of the best shows ever produced."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It is a performance that will undoubtedly get [Kate Winslet] awards season recognition next year, a circuit that is familiar ground for her. But great work never gets old."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Smart without being overly precious, but is just weird enough to keep kids' attention."
The Stand,1,"When it comes to post-apocalyptic horror, The Stand still delivers."
Hacks,1,Still fun to watch but also not quite working at the level its fans have come to expect.
Severance,1,"Although Severance impressively mixes thriller with horror and sci-fi, it never runs too far from the truth about everyones work/life balance. This show will make you reconsider how much of yourself and your personality youve given to a business."
The Wonder Years,1,"Credit the pilot of The Wonder Years 2.0 with this: With brainpower that's rare for a contemporary network sitcom, it makes its characters' relationships feel vivid and real against the backdrop of changing times."
Limitless,0,Limitless is an unneeded sequel to a should-be-forgotten 2011 sci-fi flick.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"You may be tempted to watch this ambitious package of shorts in a single sitting, though these animated appetizers are worth savoring for how rich with creativity they are."
Slow Horses,1,"By season’s end, Slow Horses feels more familiar than truly innovative, albeit with some sharper acting and jokes than most others it’s following."
The Expanse,1,"It's not exactly unfinished business, but this season is marked by the confidence of a show that's got six seasons under its belt and still doesn't particularly feel like stopping, no matter what any official announcement might say."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"Marvel's Hero Project is an uplifting and inspiring show for all the family, celebrating the amazing achievements of phenomenal real-life heroes."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is grandiose, political, and cinematic television, with epic blockbuster action scenes and standout performances from its ensemble, including from leading lady Regina King."
Invincible,1,Every single frame of this beautifully animated series is just down right stupendous...
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"None of it is required viewing for the main series and non-fans won’t be converted into full-on devotees with this short spinoff. Nevertheless, it’s exciting to see Amazon expand the world of The Boys."
Servant,1,"Consistency is key here. While the mysteries consistently pull us along for the ride, consistent character flaws will have us question how long we should stick around."
Roar,1,"Ultimately, the series is an interesting look at several uniquely feminine perspectives  and despite a few weak spots, it's worth watching for the sake of better understanding what it's like to be a woman."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"A fun and quirky adventure series for the kids, which offers up Blyton-esque intrigue, fantasy and whimsy. Disney shows they've finally found a way to make non-IP brand kid's fantasy work, and work well!"
True Detective,1,What made True Detective special was the haze of strangeness that hung about it like a supernatural mist. Let us join hands and mouth a ritualistic prayer in the hope that TD3 is every bit as weird and quietly deranged.
Twin Peaks,1,"That's what Twin Peaks might be, after it's all said and done. Not a detective caper, or gumshoe sendup, not a celebration of American tropes from diners to police stations, but strictly Dada."
Squid Game,1,"Stylish, gripping, and well-acted by an excellent ensemble cast, Squid Game will keep you pressing play, no matter how scared you get."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Shenanigans aside, what makes Little Fires Everywhere perfect for our current, stranger-than-fiction moment is the ordinariness of the lives it presents."
Squid Game,1,Totally bingeable.
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a truly comforting, uplifting teen dramedy that's so loaded up on subtle moments of friendship and romance that your ticker will likely cease functioning at points."
Alias Grace,1,Producer Sarah Polley's masterful writing transforms a brilliant novel into a captivating television experience.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"It can be very comic, then turned, suddenly, into sadness or tragedy. We get to know these guests, and even the counselors, but slowly and partly through flashbacks that, like the interactions at the spa, take time to unravel."
Severance,1,"It's a crackerjack premise brought to life by a uniformly excellent ensemble, and those are reasons enough to watch this corker of a series."
Ramy,1,"Through Ramy's increased devotion, viewers get a broader understanding of Islam's tenets of peace and self-awareness, in addition to Youssef's brand of humor, which still illuminates the difficulties of being Muslim in American culture."
Save Me,1,"It is, if anything, better than the original, charting the toxins spread throughout an entire community via just one tiny group's sociopathic sense of sexual entitlement, and thus the disjointed distrusts that must fester and breed."
Central Park,1,There is so much star power in Central Park you risk being blinded by their wattage.
Stranger Things,1,The good news is that much of this season captures what people appreciate about the show. The bad news is it also struggles with much of what has disappointed viewers.
Elite,1,"It's a pity that the series that was once an addictive madness, it now conforms to being simply madness. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peacemaker,1,James Gunn's latest project as part of the DC Extended Universe has all the makings of a success.
BoJack Horseman,1,"This may be the weightiest season of BoJack, but introspection has never dulled the show's humor or sense of fun before, and it doesn't start now."
Sweet Tooth,1,"The costumes, sets, and action scenes follow suit; all of them work in tandem to build an impressive, hard-to-describe tone, which somehow is a bullseye that hits family-friendly, high fantasy, comic book movie, and survival thriller all at once."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is a slow burn, but it's also the perfect slow burn for summer."
Community,1,Don't write-off the new season in the age of Yahoo
Mare of Easttown,1,"What makes it worth seeing are the little things in the margins, and the scenes that burrow into Mare's daily life and lingering grief."
The Stranger,1,Good fun.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"For a good time, skip to “An Animated Short…,” “Boyd in 3D,” “BFFs,” and “John and Sun-Hee.” But really, at a total runtime of two hours, Diabolical will hardly waste your time."
24,0,"This time it is far less potent. At 47, Sutherland wears Jack's evident fatigue (and extra wrinkles) like a badge, even though the script never gives him much to work with in the way of emotion or depth."
Better Call Saul,1,Within three minutes we’re reminded why this is one of the most visually creative series in television history.
Succession,1,"It's great to have Succession back. We might not want to know the members of the Roy family, but it's an absolute pleasure to see them again."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's genuinely, thrillingly, unique and certain scenes and moments will live with you long after you've finished watching."
Silicon Valley,1,It's still a very good show - and I look forward to watching the last three episodes of the season - but it's also a show that's very ready to end.
The First Lady,1,"A compelling series that grounds prominent historical figures using raw emotions and struggles, The First Lady tackles important thematic issues and shares more about life before the presidency for Michelle Obama, Betty Ford, and Eleanor Roosevelt."
Dr. Death,1,"This adaptation manages to improve on its source material, perhaps because the story of Dr. Christopher Duntsch is so monstrous, it must be seen to be believed."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"It's great to encourage younger audiences to boldly go themselves, but it also makes it difficult to pin the series' longevity and its utility beyond franchise newbies. Altogether, still an engaging and gorgeous series."
Shining Girls,1,There’s a terrific thriller trying to break out of the sometimes-confusing plot machinations here. Close scrutiny is required and rewarded with a dose of the chills. Moss is astounding
House of Cards,0,"Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Recovers the pulp spirit of the original series which, even with its well-intentioned pacifist, anti-racist messages and in favor of scientific progress and mutual understanding, was, above all, an adventure story. [Full review in Spanish]"
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria has become an aimless show -- even though it remains a hypnotizing one. In the disarray of Season 2, the series’ sense of nihilism is magnified."
The White Lotus,1,"Even when the most thinly drawn uppity guests are gnashed by White's satire, you'll savor every delectable shred of schadenfreude."
One of Us Is Lying,1,"Its a pretty classic whodunit, where everybodys a suspect and nobodys talking. By blending in teen drama  refreshingly not sanitized to satisfy network censors  it keeps things interesting while feeling comfortably familiar."
Justified,1,"A smart show knows when to quit, and sometimes after making the decision to quit, it finds itself again."
Entourage,0,"Boy did the show coast for a long, long, long time, all the way up until this limp, unenthusiastic finale."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine does the best job possible of acknowledging the problem with portraying cops as uncomplicated heroes while still remaining a good-natured, funny show, but it feels fitting, and fortunate, that this is its final season."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"A paean to friendship, to self-discovery and to the networks that are foisted upon people by the mysteries of the universe -- or college administrations -- and which can sometimes, if you're incredibly lucky, yield gold. It's a joy."
Fleabag,1,"Too many modern TV shows are obsessed with depicting how we can fall apart... Give me a hundred TV shows like Fleabag: deeply fascinated with how we put ourselves back together, a much more impressive feat."
Fargo,0,"All the details are wrong in every direction, either over the top or unbelievably absent."
The Queen's Gambit,1,More female led television series like this one please!
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Renner's ferociously powerful performance is the best thing about The Mayor of Kingstown, a gritty, highly pedigreed, impressively photographed and well-acted series..."
Minx,1,"It's a show that cares about its characters and wants the best for them, finding entertaining ways to make that happen within a larger context of continued struggle."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Nine Perfect Strangers excels in balancing its incredible ensemble cast. Every performance in the series is well-acted and thoroughly engaging.
Hellbound,1,"Hellbound unspools like a mix of Clive Barker, The Da Vinci Code and the iconic Japanese horror, Ring."
Brave New World,0,"The cast is good. The writing is mediocre. It hews closely to Aldous Huxley's novel, except when it departs from it. There are a surprisingly large amount of orgies, and yet, they are in no way the reason to watch or not to watch Brave New World."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Basketball fans might get restless waiting for the story to make it to the title run, but those less familiar with the yarn will enjoy all the off-court antics and controversies chronicled here."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"More often than not, the show’s sometimes endless willingness to get bogged down in office-life wordplay threatens to render the sublime mundane, rather than the other way around."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"The saga’s connections to epochal events and people are so fascinating and cleverly worked, it’ll be extra rewarding to watch it with your Wikipedia open."
Westworld,1,The sinister quality of Westworld remains intact and there are gripping action sequences. Yet it’s hard to tell if the series is back on the rails as a vivid exploration of the power of myth and story.
Key & Peele,1,These interstitial sequences continue to drive (heh-heh) home the quick-witted nature of these guys. They have an improv background...you don't say!
The Mist,1,"Escapism at its finest, The Mist is a excellent reinvention of Stephen King's novella that looks set to deliver a character drama married to a gorgeous thriller. With production values of the highest order, television has come a long way indeed."
Veep,1,"Veep is still as hilariously cutting as ever. Its performances are fantastic, its rhythm and density are unparalleled, and its sense of the absurd is still sharp."
Moon Knight,1,"Its the strangeness that keeps the show incredibly enticing, and though its understandable why it needs to calm itself at times to explain what exactly is going on, the moments it decides to embrace lunacy prove its most exciting."
Loki,1,I've seen the first two episodes so far and Loki should please Marvel fans. Tom Hiddleston is in prime form as our title character.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Levi's camera, as much as Bergman's, goes to the soul of that marriage. [Full re view in Spanish]"
The Muppet Show,1,"Rib-tickling, envelope-pushing, zeitgeisty appointment viewing."
Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston returns in the role he was born to play. He and Owen Wilson, hilarious as agent Mobius, are Marvel's new dream team in a series that has it all. In a word, wow!"
Bel-Air,1,"A bold reimagining that maintains the essence of the original show while exploring important social themes from an authentic, Black perspective."
House of Cards,0,"As the first made-to-binge show is finally over, we turn to its less high-falutin' spawn to release us from the chokeholds of binge-era mediocrity."
MacGruber,1,This series takes everything you love about the film and expands upon it. It's like getting two or three MacGruber sequels at once.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is, by and large, a charming show anchored by a lovable protagonist. Making good use of its extensive budget, it works equally well for kids and adult audiences, adding a heartwarming and whimsical tone to a typically grim genre."
The Umbrella Academy,0,The writers seem happy to undercut their big turns and moves without really mining them for their full emotional worth.
His Dark Materials,1,Pits [Dafne Keen] against one of the best child actors in the prestige TV landscape.
24,1,"It's always good to see an old friend, and an old pro in action. Live Another Day gives us both."
Foundation,1,"Viewers who stick with it - and sci-fi fans in particular - will be intrigued, to say the least."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Somehow, out of all the doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, Battlestar Galactica finished with something approaching a happy ending."
Hawkeye,0,This series lacks the zip and polish that Kate Bishop and Clint Barton deserve.
The X-Files,1,Things do indeed get to a place of wonder by the mid-point of the season.
Fleabag,1,The resulting second season is a meticulous triumph as gorgeous as it is wrenching.
Baymax!,1,"...BAYMAX! works from start to finish. It’s heartfelt, warm, and is a salve for increasingly darker times."
Severance,1,"Ben Stiller’s excellent new limited series, Severance, turns the corporate workplace into the setting for a new and timely subgenre: “job horror.”"
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone is good clean fun with a vengeance.
First Kill,1,"Though this show might not be for everyone, it’s definitely for all the queer girls who were Team Bella during their Twilight phase, or anyone who just wants to see a new take on a tired genre."
Homeland,1,I never believed I'd dedicate nearly 100 hours of my life to watching the series.
Succession,1,The wounded family romance it sumptuously depicts is the primordial muck from which all our desires derive.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Highly recommended if you have a spare 10-20 minutes and fancy a little bit of Star Wars, or a little bit of anime... or especially if you fancy a little bit of both!"
Mindhunter,1,"Andrew Dominik and Carl Franklin ensure that the handsome cinematography and meticulous attention to detail is maintained throughout. Jason Hill's eerie score further adds to the dark, chilling ambience."
The Americans,1,"This season really does resonate a lot with today... And it's wonderful ground, and the episodes are really interesting."
The Thing About Pam,1,"Maybe it’s a good thing to be so unmoored by a TV show. For better or worse, that destabilization, that determined desire for clarity on what this show is, will keep me watching. Yet another one of The Thing About Pam’s surprises."
Sweet Tooth,1,A lot of really great cinematography and fight scenes and visuals... A breath of fresh air.
The Crown,1,"It's better than the last, which got bogged down a little in dead times. But there is, with modern times, the temptation to take sides; and there's little doubt where creator Peter Morgan has nailed his colours."
Squid Game,1,"Compulsively watchable although, in the end, his dark dystopian story is lightened by transforming his protagonist into yet another hero. Forget it, Jake. It's Netflix."
Foundation,1,"Outside of aesthetic considerations, the series' first two episodes focus on themes that are both poignant and agonizingly familiar."
Monsters at Work,1,"A wonderful little workplace comedy for younger audiences. While it never quite captures a true Pixar charm, it's an enjoyable series that feels like both an organic follow-up, and love-letter to the original movie."
Bates Motel,1,"It was all creepy as hell, but it was an 'aww' kind of creepy. The creepiest creepy 'aww' ever, but still we can't help but say it. Aww. Rest in peace, Norman."
Halo,1,"While I understand that Halo Season 1 needed to build upon a universe and build up to a Season 2 that’s grander in scope, it is abundantly clear that the show is at its best when it embraces that it is, in fact, Halo..."
The White Lotus,1,"This series features a great cast, an incredibly weaved narrative, and a mystery that keeps you on your toes until the very end."
Chucky,1,"It won't win over many new converts, but anyone with a soft spot for the cheery maniac doll will no doubt get a kick out of his latest reign of terror."
Mare of Easttown,1,The willful griminess and funk of the first episode might turn you off but stick with the show as Mare investigates the murder of a young woman and the disappearance of two others.
The Baby,1,"While the first episode takes a bit of time to get going, once it does it’s clear there’s some “Servant”-like dark fun to be had watching this “Baby.”"
The White Lotus,1,All this is delicately anatomised over the course of a strong story just soapy enough to let it slip around easily but not so much that it doesn't snag your attention.
Harlots,1,"Love a duck, Harlots was a rum do. Set among prostitutes in Georgian London, it was not sure if it was Arthur or Martha, a comedy or a drama, but it certainly grabbed the attention with both hands."
The Owl House,1,"It’s not just the gruesome landmarks and queer romance that have made The Owl House such a teen fandom mainstay, however. It’s how much fun Terrace and the rest of her creative team are clearly having."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The result of [the writers'] plan was among the more maddening things I've seen in the finale of a show I at one point loved.
Schmigadoon!,1,"The show is full of glorious musical numbers with impeccable costumes, sets and choreography, performed by some of the best stage and screen musical stars working right now."
Invincible,1,"Quite a credible family dynamic is created for a cartoon, not to mention one with demon detectives and bickering blue bad guys."
Black Sails,1,The season looks like it's off to a strong start.
Scandal,1,"I can already tell that Scandal's final season is going to feel like one long ""what if?"" episode - and I'm not mad about it at all."
The Fall,1,Allan Cubitt certainly knows how to hook an audience.
11.22.63,1,"11.22.63 isn't for everyone. You have to like what-if fantasy stories. But like many of King's stories, once you're in, you're in. Enjoy the trip."
The Good Place,1,"It only sometimes makes me sad when I remember what life was like the last time I watched new episodes of The Good Place, which was ... only nine months ago."
Brave New World,1,"Regardless of whether you are familiar with the novel or not, this is a world that is very easy to escape into, and by doing so the series demands we ask bigger questions about the nature of escape itself."
The Staircase,1,"It’s also a reminder of the genius of Colin Firth, who, as Michael Peterson, is at the center of the show and holds it expertly. It’s a cliché to say that an actor disappears into his role, but there it is"
Sharp Objects,1,Adams seems to show another facet of his chameleon personality in the miniseries. [Full review in Spanish]
Breaking Bad,1,"We get the neatness and the uncertainty, which shows a Heisenberg level of mastery."
Schmigadoon!,1,"A really endearing, frothy ode to 1940s musicals in the style of Rogers and Hammerstein and Cole Porter."
Friends,1,"While not one of the absolute greats, The Last One deserves a place here for reasons of sentimentality. Put simply, it's the last one. It's the end of an era. That's not to say it lacks for laughs. There are plenty here."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,Expecting a series equal to what Bergman achieved would be expecting too much indeed... Yet the acting and writing manage to overcome any qualms.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"[Bridget Everett is] the kind of person you just can't take your eyes off of, and Somebody Somewhere is poised to -- finally -- turn her into a really huge star."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's so crisp, so vivid, so real."
WandaVision,1,"This is such a departure for Marvel Studios that it may take a few episodes to settle into the excruciatingly slow pace of this unique, funny, weird trip into sitcom TV History."
For All Mankind,1,"The power of For All Mankind is that it makes space both unreachable and attainable simultaneously. It’s a serious and gritty show, but through all of that darkness and real-world drama, there’s genuine excitement."
Loki,1,"Mobius and Loki make for an effective odd couple, with the ""full-tilt diva"", as Tony Stark put it in Avengers Assemble, butting up against the unruffled, surfer-dude energy of Wilson's agent."
The Morning Show,1,"The Morning show is still a show about sexism, misogyny, and the prejudice dynamics that endanger many to protect a few, Yet, this season observed how even the helpless can sell out."
The Boys,1,"The way The Boys captures how futile the struggle to do and be good can feel sometimes, when the systems in place seem like they can never be fixed for the better, gives it a certain relevance to today that frankly it’d be nice to ignore."
The Undoing,1,The narrative starts to gel once Kidman begins attempting to navigate the mess her life has become. It's what makes Big Little Lies thrive and The Undoing a good show.
The Staircase,1,The Staircase makes tantalizing equivalences between the filmmaking process and the justice system.
Queer as Folk,1,"Peacock’s Queer As Folk hits hard but feels needed. It’s not perfect, but that gives us much to discuss."
Better Call Saul,1,"The devil is in the details, but so is everything else. It’s a pleasure to be three steps behind."
Euphoria,1,"Levinson's ability to make audiences feel what the characters are experiencing is masterful and discomfiting, all at once."
Rome,1,"The writers are careful to make their most daring historical reaches plausible, consistent, and, of course, dramatically effective."
Big Little Lies,1,The entire second season works better than it has any right to...
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers arms itself with trippy, dream-like reconstructions and quirky, theatrical breakdowns of real-life events."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"For some, [the] surprise was a disappointment. But disappointment is expecting that a life has only one love story, that happily ever after only happens once, that surprises, good and bad, happen along the way."
The Shrink Next Door,1,It would all seem a tad daft and overblown if it wasn't for the fact that it all really happened. Just with a less attractive psychiatrist.
Westworld,1,One may miss the intriguing narrative loops and interior fugues of seasons one and two... But there is nonetheless shivery fun to be had as Westworld imagines what was probably the inevitable outcome of all this tinkering with synthetic thought.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,'The Bad Batch' was a very welcome return for The Clone Wars. Its impressive visuals and balance of action and focus on the characters makes it feel as if the series had never left.
The Wheel of Time,1,A perfect lockdown watch for those wishing to escape to another world.
Foundation,1,"Foundation's ten episodes are sumptuous TV and showrunner David S. Goyer has successfully brought an extremely difficult book series to life on the screen, even if it doesn't really feel much like the original source material."
Swagger,1,"The storytelling in 'Swagger' is nimble, unpredictable, and keeps me on my toes."
Swagger,1,"A lesser show might buckle under the weight of all such heavy-duty issues. But while Swagger does wobble here and there, it handles most of these plot points as deftly as its characters do a ball."
The Offer,0,A Limited Series That Should've Been A Movie.
One of Us Is Lying,1,Passionate fans of the YA novel this steamy teen series is based on will be glad to know the TV version's mostly faithful to the book and is well-made and arresting yet cliched and slow to start.
Harlots,1,"[T]here's still been something truly gutsy and fearless at the heart of season 3, and that's the reason this show is so incredibly compelling and watchable."
Limitless,0,"Those who haven't seen the Bradley Cooper film this is based on may enjoy the novelty of it more than I did, but I mostly found it lacking compared to the movie version."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Young Beth Harmon (played equally brilliantly by Isla Johnston as a child and Anya Taylor-Joy as a teenager and adult) is a poor waif living in a Kentucky orphanage... Bright lights beckon, as do darker things. Captivating."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,One of the best medical dramas to hit the small screen in years.
The Twilight Zone,1,"Season 2 is satisfyingly spooky and twisted, with a wry sense of humor."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd have terrific chemistry in performances that could have skewed grim, lightening up a chilling premise."
Pachinko,1,I came out of Pachinko frantic for another chapter in Sunja's story  and knowing more about Korean-Japanese relations than I learned in four years of higher education.
Bodyguard,0,"It's a failed opportunity, and the result is a story that offers tantalizing threads of complexity, only to cut them all off right as they start combining into something truly innovative."
Acapulco,1,"Acapulco is, at its core, wholesome and genuinely feelgood television. And that makes me feel, oh, I don't know, sort of anxious."
Midnight Mass,0,"""Midnight Mass"" has something to say. It just can't help saying it too loudly-and without bothering to stop and spook us out."
WeCrashed,1,"Jared Leto gives another immersive performance, and the show doesn't tell you how you should think about Adam Neumann. It's ""The Social Network"" meets ""The Wolf of Wall Street"""
Big Little Lies,1,"Though the actresses on the series did a tremendous job with the often underwritten material they were given, the series did not deliver on the promises it set up in Season One."
Normal People,1,"Hulu's Normal People is a rare television series that focuses on romance as its core, rather than a byproduct of the actual plot."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass goes further than tension or thrills, presenting a dense and somehow hopeful epic that leans into the existential terror of being alive."
The OA,1,"This new season is even more ambitious than the first, tackling some heady concepts and delving into truly bizarre and mind-bending territory."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"That ""Star Wars: Visions"" is, finally, more of a pleasant diversion than a really fulfilling experience isn't a factor of running time or talent."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,I'll give it 3.5 Tweedledees on a scale of 5 Tweedledums. Once Upon A Time In Wonderland is very nice to look at.
The First,1,"""Godspeed"" was a phrase used. At this point it could do with a bit of speed itself."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll 2 jumps the shark quickly; the narrative is too different, and meanderingly self-indulgent, and the charm of the cast wears thin"
Bodyguard,1,"Already it's a wild, thrilling ride. One thing is clear: Bodyguard is heading nowhere obvious."
Community,1,"There's no obvious evidence of budget cuts in the move to Yahoo, so consider this a positive start for the latest version of Community."
Invincible,1,"With its fun '80s-inspired animation style and stellar voice cast, Invincible is worth checking out for superhero genre fans. That said, it offers very little that we haven't seen before."
Forever,1,"A funny, poignant and even surreal exploration into the power of love and the strength of long-term commitment."
Defending Jacob,1,You will love watching the episodes but after it is over you won't feel very good about it.
Lisey's Story,0,"Theres no internal logic to Liseys Story, and theres little formal filmmaking logic, either."
Little Voice,0,"Bess's songs always sound smooth and polished, which contradicts their supposed purpose as messy personal statements."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Even if this wasn't the end, season three meanders far too often to leave any kind of lasting impression."
Unbelievable,1,"This is biting, gripping, and not least moving."
Girls5eva,1,"It’s not immediately delivering the kind of sublimely satirical songs that made the first season such a masterpiece. It’s still great fun, though, as the middle-aged survivors of ’90s girl band Girls5eva continue their shaky comeback."
Y: The Last Man,1,"The Y: The Last Man series is a terse, slow simmering, at times head-scratching, but engaging take on a particular kind of apocalypse."
Bridgerton,1,"Take my word, dear reader, this second helping of the smash Netflix series still smolders. Despite  a drag at midpoint and the no-show of season-one sex magnet Regé-Jean Page, the dishy cosplay brims over with eye-popping spectacle and ravishing romance."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"With a cast this strong, it’s worth seeing where this mission goes next."
Cheers,0,We waited 11 years for this? Last night's finale kept tantalizing us with possibilities that never quite materialized.
The Afterparty,1,"""The Afterparty"" is a whodunit that understands the rules of the game well."
Moon Knight,1,"There's enough intrigue established to inspire curiosity about just how it's all going to play out, in the end, and Isaacs's performance alone is enough to recommend it."
The Morning Show,1,"The Morning Show is a camp masterpiece. Liberated from its previous desire to parse events in a meaningful way, it's become stranger and more fun."
The Wheel of Time,1,The Wheel of Time is a very strong start to a much-awaited series and created by someone who has a clear understanding of how adaptations can soar when complementing their source material rather than just copying it.
Shadow and Bone,1,It was absolutely incredible to see these unforgettable characters come to life.
WandaVision,0,"Despite its laugh tracks and various winks and nods, the Marvel superhero series is lacking in its homage to iconic television."
The Morning Show,1,"Ultimately, it was a mess of a season, one where - aside from killing off Mitch Kessler - the series didn't advance the story much... Still, as beset by problems as it is, it was a very watchable season."
Dr. Death,1,The generally underrated Joshua Jackson carries Dr. Death with a fascinating blend of idiotic confidence and nonchalant sociopathology.
Black Mirror,1,An anthology of this calibre can be forgiven its weaker moments and this season does enough to leave you wanting more.
Loki,1,God bless Owen Wilson.
The Good Place,1,"It's a promising start to the latest phase of this unpredictable gem, even as I'm eager to be done with set-up and dive into whatever strange ideas Schur and company have for us farther down the line."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is finally here and breathes new life in classic characters and elements from Star Trek history to great effect.
The Good Wife,1,"Because of economics and viewer demographics, there may never be a show like The Good Wife again."
Entourage,1,"Though the four friends always kept us coming back for more, Vince's agent, Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven), was the real driving force of the show."
Inventing Anna,1,"Ultimately, Garner’s committed performance adds a layer of complexity to Inventing Anna that might otherwise be absent."
Loki,0,A handful of good ideas lost amid an uninspired narrative.
Titans,1,This barnstorming third season really puts Titans on the map.
Review,1,Forrest's commitment to his ridiculous job makes Review some of the most arresting comedy in recent memory.
Chernobyl,1,"The triumph of Chernobyl as a mini-series, then, has less to do with its uncanny ability to present an accurate picture of the past, and more about its prescient ability to gaze forward."
Queer as Folk,1,"It may be trash TV, but it’s OUR trash TV, and that makes all the difference."
Treadstone,0,A forgettable espionage drama with a tenuous connection to a popular character who never appears and is never mentioned.
Fargo,1,"Even when it isn't peak Fargo and despite being weighted down by ambitions that aren't fully realized thus far, there are sweeping swathes of greatness here."
Review,1,Review: five out of five stars.
House,0,"""Everybody Dies"" is a failure of ambition, a frustratingly slapdash affair that tries to hide its lack of ideas behind the usual forced theatrics, reeking of a fan-fiction-like conviction in its own awesomeness. And it sucked. Hard."
Foundation,0,"Whether Foundation works for you is going to depend on your mileage for sci-fi. If you're a dedicated junkie, already conversant in either Asimov's writings or in the genre tropes, it's likely a lot easier to digest."
The First,1,"Sean Penn, in his first TV series regular role, delivers a tremendously affecting performance as Providence commander Tom Hagerty."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a complex character that takes some time to settle in to grasp the dualityalthough once alight, you cant help but have a good time predicting what these two are going to do nextas Oscar Issac truly glows in this role!"
Bodyguard,1,"This enthralling thriller series should come with warnings about how anxiety-inducing it is, as well as how much you'll now want Richard Madden to play James Bond."
A Teacher,0,"A Teacher is just an uncomfortable, frustrating viewing experience, and not in the ways it's meant to be."
Taboo,1,"I was heartily sick of gloomy, gritty TV shows, but engaging ones can't help but pull me in... I think I'm officially in."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"With the exception of Ms. Van Patten's Zoe, you wouldn't give your extra bottle of kombucha to any of these people."
Bodyguard,1,The plot makes up in symmetry what it may lack in believability.
And Just Like That...,1,"Really, the greatest joy of And Just Like That... is also its most modest one: the simple pleasure of being back in the company of the women we know and love."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"With Season 7 being Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s last, it's a relief that the series has finally done right by Daisy in the romance department with a relationship that is genuinely endearing and built on trust and mutual respect."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Season three is a series of dreams that unfolds with a kind of absolute possibility. I’m never tired of the soft interlude between one episode and the next, when the potential for the following imaginative leap is gently waiting behind the credits."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Although the writing is crisp and the storyline intriguing, Lincoln Lawyer doesn’t quite reach the heights of The Practice, Boston Legal or The Good Wife."
Dark Winds,1,"Both a Western and a noir thriller that is at its most interesting when it delves into these deeper contradictions, it often loses focus on a fraught journey towards something more reflective."
Bosch,1,This final season was blessedly void of that sense of headlong rush to the finish so many fan-favorites get when given the same chance to plan their swan song in advance.
The First,0,"Visually compelling with a nicely pensive music score - courtesy of Colin Stetson of Arcade Fire and Bon Iver - ""The First"" is otherwise plodding and padded."
Love Life,1,"Love Life returns for a new season, different characters and a different story, and it is formidably good and engaging."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"This show only produced 18 episodes, but it's been lauded and beloved for 16 years since its unceremonious axing."
Hellbound,1,Such good writing.
The Thing About Pam,1,"Its purpose, generally, is to keep things reassuringly intimate, and above the fray. Such things aside, all in all this is a wholly compelling tale."
Landscapers,1,"If Sinclair's bold concept and script lift it well above the average crime drama, the direction, by Will Sharpe, is what makes Landscapers unforgettable."
Inventing Anna,1,Settle in for an utterly bingeable bit of fluff about a woman who is never quite who she claims to be.
Legion,1,Legion wasn't ever going to be a show with a traditional happy ending. But maybe this is as close as it gets.
11.22.63,1,"Masterfully textured and compellingly told, 11.22.63 is a smart and stylish take on Stephen King's sprawling novel."
The Staircase,1,"Perfect material worth binging.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Fargo,1,"Hawley has more than proved that he's a worthy foe of tropes and cliches, but here, his vision can at times feel detrimentally self-indulgent... What does work here, at times terrifically, is the complete shift in setting."
The Thing About Pam,1,"The Thing About Pam stars Zellweger as another monster and she brings an equal amount of vinegary exuberance to the work. But instead of playing a fantasy figure of cold depravity, she’s playing a real person."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is an engrossing and perfectly put together series.
Deadwood,1,Deadwood is just littered with talent.
What If...?,1,"As a short-form animation without an overriding plot What If...? is more interesting than gripping, and sometimes the animation style looks a bit stiff on-screen (though notably, less so in the excellent action scenes)."
Atlanta,1,The opening episodes of the FX hit’s third season quite literally take the show to new places. Yet they also show how ‘Atlanta’ is now mature enough to start revisiting familiar themes.
Sweet Tooth,1,"""Sweet Tooth"" may not offer a full meal, but sometimes all you need is a good piece of chocolate."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad did what any show would hope to do: bring its narrative to a natural, organic conclusion while also leaving us wishing the story could just go on and on."
Sweet Tooth,1,"There is a great deal of jeopardy along the way, but the scenes always come back to something reassuring, and there is no gore."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses is a comedy, something of a satire of le Carre-style capers, but it also manages to be a genuinely twisty, old-school spy thriller at the same time. So twisty in fact, it’s hard to keep up"
The Afterparty,1,"The series' two best episodes, ""Yasper"" and ""Zoe,"" go all out...The other 5 episodes are still good, but given how the show excels when it truly commits, they feel vaguely like missed opportunities."
Evil,1,"Finds David at a crossroads, with his disillusionment with the Catholic Church increasing rather than diminishing."
The Gilded Age,1,"Nowhere near the depth and feeling of Downton Abbey, but the sets and costumes are wonderful.  Christine Baranski inhabits her wonderfully cantankerous role, but Louisa Jacobson falls flat as the main character."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things 4 is the most cinematic season we have seen yet, as every episode feels like a movie. There is a lot happening, but the way it all comes together down the stretch is brilliant."
The Good Wife,1,Perhaps it was appropriate that we ended the series with Peter emphatically denying that he buried evidence and those advising Alicia saying that he probably did.
Riverdale,1,"Riverdale itself just embracing the utter insanity of the source material, especially when it’s done such a grand job of being so insane itself previously, is more of a lateral move than some huge leap."
Black Mirror,1,"These episodes are lighter than you might expect from Black Mirror. There's no pitch-black Crocodile in amongst this batch, and one of them is positively a romp, but that's not to say that the themes aren't heavy."
Jersey Shore,0,"Now that the Jersey Shore cast members have moved past the reasons they got cast in the first place and, more importantly, become too famous for the show to pretend otherwise, it's time to recycle."
Normal People,1,"An utterly captivating & rare portrayal of a complicated love which will sweep you off your feet. You'll laugh, you'll cry & you'll fall in love all over again."
WeCrashed,0,"There’s only so much posturing, partying and profligacy one can take before it gets wearisome."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Not quite up to ""Bosch"" level of entertainment yet but getting there fast."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Arguably the most compelling, edgy actor on television. Kidman's performances and her hair always make for fascinating viewing, and Nine Perfect Strangers is no exception."
WeCrashed,1,"A handsome production that’s easy to watch, but one without enough consequence to merit the time."
Lovecraft Country,1,Horrors Both Human and Otherworldly Haunt Misha Green's Spellbinding Series
The Undoing,1,I could watch Grant all day as Jonathan Fraser.
The Affair,1,"The Affair has always been a fascinating show to watch because much like its characters, it has never feared following its instincts down the wildest paths possible, even if those instincts lead to some terrible choices."
Prehistoric Planet,1,Prehistoric Planet is an impressive technical docuseries that shows what life might have been like millions of years ago.
The Office,1,"As the show moves into its final seasons, the parody eases up and even Jim comes to realize that the office where he spends the majority of his waking hours is where the most significant relationships of his life will be formed."
True Detective,1,"Exploring the grim certainty of battling time, Ali carries the show by subtly pushing against expectations, finding empathy in the murkiest darkness that True Detective has ever explored."
Amazing Stories,0,"Apple only provided the series' first episode for critics to review, so maybe the next four installments will be more creative and exciting."
Sex and the City,1,"While the show set high expectations for countless New York City migrants, it remains a fixture of the conversation."
The Baby,1,"It all sounds weird, and it is. But this “Baby” knows how to deliver on its premise and its promise."
Severance,1,"Funny, terrifying, and brilliant in equal measure, Apple TV+s Severance is one of the most impressive new shows of the last couple years."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,There isn't anything about Arcane that I would call new or revolutionary. It's a fairly typical fantasy tale that just happens to be really well done.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It never gains any momentum, and despite the presence of Ferrell and Rudd, it all feels sadly underwhelming."
Taboo,0,"As Hardy has demonstrated in several other projects, he is eminently watchable... But Taboo seems to have no idea what to do with his presence, short of giving him a scar and wrapping him in black broadcloth."
Gaslit,1,"The political aspect of this story is like Succession by way of Spitting Image  Stevens is Cousin Gregging all over the place, and Penn looks like one of the puppets."
Waco,1,"Though it's difficult to say whether or not the 1993 Waco siege warrants revisiting, the Paramount Network's new six-part miniseries does the best job of examining such a loaded question."
Moon Knight,1,"Hardcore fans of the character may quibble with some of the changes made to the mythos, but Isaac and Hawke really sell this character-oriented Marvel adventure."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Wheel of Time is very self-serious, which makes it easy to mock, particularly if you're apt to make comparisons to other fantasy franchises: One screechy villain has Voldemort's nose; an Army of horned beasts are this show's version of Orcs."
Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone is merely the latest reasonably handsome streaming series whose aspirations beyond qualifying as a mild diversion turn out to be mostly smoke and mirrors.
Loki,1,"After two episodes, Loki is at a tipping point. Having set everything up to an exhausting degree, things could be lined up to get really entertaining."
Star Trek: Voyager,1,The upshot is that Janeway is put in the kind of moral quandary that Trek thrives on: Should she let the entire Borg Collective perish to save an innocent few?
Russian Doll,1,"The wider scope and deeper questions of Russian Doll’s second season thrillingly build on the first season’s foundation, and bring the viewer along for an extremely satisfying ride."
The Americans,1,The Americans talks far more eloquently about politics and history than I imagined it would when it started... Good for The Americans to have so presciently anticipated a cultural shift and so engagingly explored it.
Stranger Things,1,"There’s still a lot to enjoy about Season 4, and “Stranger Things” remains an entertaining show. But, it also feels like it’s biting off more than it can chew."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Unlike the advent of the original franchise, this new series isn't a game changer. But it is a delight. And that's something to quack about."
Severance,1,"Thought-provoking, thrilling, and impeccably well made, Severance is a remarkable achievement in long-form storytelling; a show so good that it reminded me of what I felt after watching Inception for the first time."
Rome,1,"Though every detail of this lush Roman epic feels palpably authentic, history lessons don't loom overly large; what's most enjoyable about it is how deftly it mixes soap opera with senatorial debates."
The Crown,1,"Diana's entry into The Crown has been anticipated since the series was first announced, and Corrin's portrayal of the Princess of Wales is delicate and assured enough to live up to the high expectations first-time viewers of the series may have."
Mythic Quest,1,They're enriching their own universe and playing off each other and actually trying to tell human stories.
Outer Banks,1,"Maybe it's a show that's still trying too hard at points, but it's easy to imagine that fans of ""Outer Banks"" watching Season 2 will find much of what they're searching for."
The Nevers,1,The exciting revelations about Amalia's past promise to redefine the show's future. If it has one.
Invincible,1,"Invincible is not for sensitive stomachs and, happily, it doesn't want to be. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is upbeat and gentle, full of sunlight and bright colours, with a welcome lightness of touch. Maybe the best way to describe it is to say that its a very inviting series  nice, in the most earnest and least dismissive sense of the word."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"With a series that relies this much on turning early gags into later drama, and on piecing together big emotions out of small beginnings, the binge experience is likely to be a lot more compelling."
The Crown,1,It's the kind of run that would have kept the Queen Mum glued to the telly.
Schmigadoon!,1,"Bright, colorful, and lots of surreal fun, this series spoofing creaky old musicals both satirizes the conventions of the genre and gives us a central story to hold onto."
Monsters at Work,0,"It's great to see Mike, Sully, and Cecilia again, but the nostalgia isn't worth it. Monsters, Inc. was something special. Monsters at Work may look like its inspiration, but it sure doesn't feel like it."
The OA,1,"Ben-Adir is great here, with his seen-it-all shrug and effortless cool, and his presence gives us a viewer surrogate who's just as confused and exasperated by all this pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo as we are."
Casual,1,"It's about love, not hate, so while certain critics may feel the need to lash out in anger at a thing of beauty pulled from us too soon, these four seasons provide a lifetime of moments to treasure."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,This season is relentless from the get-go and absolutely does not disappoint as the Man Without Fear returns from the dead to bring down one of his most iconic villains.
Chuck,1,"So it's farewell and goodbye to one of the most unique shows on TV: one that combined great action scenes with snappy one-liners, unique characterisation, more pop culture references and iconic guest star"
13 Reasons Why,0,"There's no revenge story here; no real mystery; and no one gets their comeuppance. It drifts until the shocking death, which erases most of the storyline that came before it, or at least reduces it to an afterthought."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As a final season arc, it simply doesn't hold the kind of water it needs to, to take the show to the kind of satisfying conclusion fans are going to want."
Band of Brothers,1,"... balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war."
Godless,1,"If he (Scott Frank) doesn't achieve the visual or narrative poetry of the filmmakers he's riffing on -- the John Fords, Howard Hawkses and Robert Altmans -- he still gives you plenty to look at, and it's never boring."
Bodyguard,1,"It can also be a blast, if you're all about the mystery and the forward momentum and your requirements for plausibility and psychological realism aren't high."
WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed makes for a reasonably entertaining reenactment by relishing in the can-you-believe-this-crap absurdity of Neumann’s worst impulses, but has little to add to the beats we already know by heart."
Swagger,1,"With its powerful themes and sterling performances, the next great sports drama has arrived."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"This new ""Scenes"" can be hell to sit through across most of its five hours. Yet as a showcase for the deep talents and remarkable chemistry of its stars, it can be one hell of a thing."
Chernobyl,1,It entertains you and they never lose sight of the fact that they're treading very delicate water here.
Unbelievable,1,"If you like procedural crime dramas, it's top-notch."
Dark Winds,1,"As both a period piece and a cultural primer for an unabashedly Native American story told through a Native American lens, Dark Winds successfully gives audiences a different perspective and backdrop for a crime drama."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Graham is a delight for kids and parents alike, striking a successful balance between nostalgia and novelty..."
And Just Like That...,0,"Too often, even when King and company mean well, the new show gives in to all of SATC's worst and sloppiest instincts. Most of it is not terrible, though the parts that are are very, very terrible."
Midnight Mass,1,Yet another winner from Mike Flanagan. A chilling examination of faith with knockout performances -- particularly Hamish Linklater and Samantha Sloyan.
Steven Universe,1,"Steven Universe's queerness isn't just about the show's superficial trappings, it's baked into a core message: fight for love against all odds."
Shadow and Bone,1,"A refreshing new world...complex, charismatic, and so much fun."
Taboo,1,"Dark, violent period drama explores a mysterious history."
The Sopranos,1,"Any explanation... no matter how smart or well-reasoned, misses the point. To explain it would diminish it."
WandaVision,1,"Brimming with assurance, the television series is a concoction of risk that pays off."
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob comes close to being good, but it relies too heavily on melodrama and never delivers the emotion the heavy subject matter deserves."
The Nevers,0,"[In] order to hold on to this show past just its one season, and in order for it to survive past the Joss Whedon shadow, it needs to make major changes."
The First,1,"Penn is solid and stolid as Hagerty, conveying more depth in the scenes with his family than he does with his crew."
The Night Of,1,The Night Of doesn't sugarcoat the biases and racism in a show bluntly depicting a murder investigation and trial.
The Americans,1,"The Americans was something special, and Weisberg created something beautiful here. Hopefully, people realize what they've missed."
The Right Stuff,0,"A blandly-cast, boringly-acted, dully-written, flatly-directed and instantly-forgotten bore."
Limitless,0,Limitless will continue to fill up the middle with lots of middling material.
Lovecraft Country,1,"On the one hand, it's a cracking good adventure story, and on the other it's a searing portrait of racial injustice in America."
The Boys,1,Don't let the calm status quo that opens the new season of Amazon's gonzo anti-superhero series fool you: it's a dizzying spectacle of gore and grim humor.
Station Eleven,1,It seems it's only a matter of time before one of these bugs has our number and many of us find ourselves in Miranda's absurd situation...
The First,0,What we're left with is a show that often drags and leads to a kind of clichéd melodrama that has a lot of ideas but isn't always successful at executing them.
Covert Affairs,1,Please let there be a sixth season of Covert Affairs. I need to know if Annie wears a gun under her wedding dress.
Lost,1,"Ultimately, Lost: Season 6 delivers closure on a story that has captivated us for so long."
The Wilds,1,"In Season 2, every aspect I loved about Season 1 is amplified. The teen drama feels real, the survival is gripping, and the plot both pays off the previous cliffhanger and sets up an equally intriguing one."
Swagger,1,"Whether you're a basketball junkie or a casual fan, Swagger is an instantly captivating and authentic dramatic ride."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While the show definitely unpacks the moral gray areas its players exist in, the characters' conceptualizations of themselves are all very black and white."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,[Moffat] takes the melodrama down a notch and salts the schmaltz with wit where he can.
The Shrink Next Door,0,Disturbing - and not in an entertaining way.
Raised by Wolves,1,"There is simply nothing like Raised by Wolves on television. It’s sci-fi, but it also really leans into fantasy. It’s stocked with strange ideas and compelling performances, and has a keen sense of aesthetic."
Severance,1,"The show’s otherworldly, Kaufmanesque aesthetic, from Jeremy Hindle’s corporately brutal production design to Theodore Shapiro’s eerie score, belies a great humanity."
Home Before Dark,1,"It's not exactly an Amblin feel, but it's in that ballpark - it's a murder mystery, but it has a sense of wonder and a delightfully precocious kid that even adults can look up to."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is an epic that truly has the feel of an epic, but with a through-line of oppression and racism that permeates every time period it portrays."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Mayor of Kingstown wants to be brutal and dark, it wants to be educational, it wants to be character driven, but no element is handled with enough care or attention."
Gaslit,1,Sporadically amusing.
The Man in the High Castle,1,"The show has left some of its less effective storylines at the wayside and strengthened its final season with only the best aspects of its strong characters, compelling alternate history, and mysterious but promising cross-dimensional possibilities."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Whether you're a Star Wars veteran or a newbie, there's plenty to enjoy in the fun, breezy entertainment Visions packs into nine short episodes."
The Expanse,1,"A strong send-off, with hope for the future."
The Offer,0,"A soulless, vapid piece of Content™ that’s about as far removed from “art” as professionally produced television can get."
Loot,1,Is it a bit preachy? Kind of. Does it hedge its bets? Often. But by the end of the series it has done enough to make you care about its characters.
Lisey's Story,0,Another King adaptation that can be added to that long list of disappointments with this wasted snooze fest.
The Night Of,1,Everything that HBO has wanted out of a drama since True Detective sparked then fizzled is available in spades in The Night Of.
Chernobyl,1,"By focusing on the commonly human instead of getting bogged down in politics or tempted by the lure of a central set-piece spectacle, is where Chernobyl stands out."
Invasion,1,"We're on board with Invasion because of its performances and cinematic look. We're just concerned that there won't be any there there, and the show will spend its first season spinning its wheels more than advancing its story."
Chuck,1,This is a program with some clever writing and a strong ensemble that has still never quite figured out its identity.
Succession,1,"Happy, nasty viewing."
"Roswell, New Mexico",0,"For a show with a stellar cast and a wide array of fascinating characters, it still struggles to get it right after all these years."
The Right Stuff,0,These men deserve better than to be rendered as faceless characters living in the world of a run-of-the-mill TV drama.
The Me You Can't See,1,"A lot of people might believe in you, but all you need sometimes is for someone to believe you."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects feels like it has the most to prove, insistently taking up prestige drama standards and then repositioning, reworking, or flat-out challenging them."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Playing a cult-like figure running a secretive resort, the only thing wobblier than the Australian Oscar winner's Russian accent are the lifeless scripts."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"This series needs something to give it a distinct appeal and I have yet to really find that in these early episodes. Because of Sheridan's track record and Renner in the lead, I will stick with Mayor of Kingstown but maybe only for a single term."
Loki,1,"If anything, it's a little too easy, and as the star rather than a supporting player, Hiddleston can sometimes appear to be coasting through the so-so material."
Moon Knight,1,"Due to the deeper mythology and the diversity of the characters, theres a lot to enjoy. It feels respectful, instead of a cultural grab for the sake of something different."
The Night Of,1,"What redeemed the show... was Ahmed's magnificent performance, and the disturbing, and convincing, coming of age his character underwent during his time behind bars."
WandaVision,1,"There are a couple of genuinely surreal, even creepy moments. One dinner table scene from the first episode actually gives off strong Lynchian vibes, calling to mind the filmmaker's bizarre 1977 debut, Eraserhead."
Bates Motel,1,Thanks to the four years of accumulated backstory that's come before -- along with the ongoing knowledge of where this ends -- even the most incidental moments take on additional emotional weight.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Winning Time seems so intent on insisting that it’s a fun show that it neglects the fundamentals.
Chernobyl,1,It's a portrait of a meltdown on too many levels to count. It doesn't take a nuclear physicist to see why it makes a lot of sense to look back on this moment right now.
Girls,1,"Straight back in, then, to Dunham's now-familiar world of millennial entitlement and ennui, and not much has changed."
True Detective,1,Ali's performance as old man crumbling as the loss of his vast intelligence accelerates is wrenching. The old-age makeup is the best this viewer has ever seen and is utterly convincing.
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker isn't quite as sharply written as Amazon's The Boys, but James Gunn is aiming for the same sort of subversive superhero show, using excessive violence and biting humor to deconstruct the failings of the genre."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"The talent of Ben Whishaw shines on its highest beams in this medical series about Adam Kay, who left his career as a junior doctor in obstetrics at a London hospital to fictionalize his life into a comedy of shocking gravity. You’ll laugh till it hurts."
Calls,0,"Truly, Calls is a collection of choices that I mostly just don't understand."
The Night Of,1,This is Turturro at the top of his game.
The Queen's Gambit,1,Anna Taylor-Joy is a joy to behold as the prodigy chess player. The series could have been shortened but the overall effect is solid entertainment.
Normal People,1,"It's one of the best works of TV I've watched so far this year, and the rare show during this pandemic stay-at-home saga that made me forget everything else."
Westworld,1,"At this point, you sort of have to admire Westworld's resistance to crowd pleasing. We're so far beyond the lauded robot cowboy show at this point, I've swerved back around into begrudgingly respecting the Nolans' absurdly complicated narrative."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,“The Lincoln Lawyer” is a clear streaming win that could’ve easily played just as well on network television.
The Man in the High Castle,1,"Season four allowed more time with Brennan Brown's Robert Childan, the antique dealer who is left somewhat in limbo... Their arc was a refreshing bit of light in a very dark season, and Brown deserves credit for doing a lot with often very little."
The Americans,1,This terrific series promises to end with a triumphant bang - don't miss it.
Stranger Things,1,"Overall, Stranger Things Season Four feels like it set itself up to be ambitious and is almost there. It has some of the best storytelling of the series since Season One and has some big payoffs for longtime fans."
The Vampire Diaries,1,The way people talk about Buffy today is how they're going to talk about TVD in years to come. It's not over. It's eternal.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Like many streaming series, thus one can feel a little overlong, a little too involved with loose storylines that don’t add to the essence. But, throughout, Samuel L. Jackson dazzles in a down-to-earth way."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"witty, heartfelt, and utterly compelling"
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,This crossover with the seismic force of Korean content — in the golden age that it is in right now — surely throws open the sheer scope of what Netflix can achieve with its ever-growing library of popular franchises.
Rome,1,"By challenging the liberal conviction that all power corrupts, the show, despite its flaws, has finally become a drama worthy of HBO's name."
True Detective,1,"I thought ""True Detective"" was dead in 2015 after a disastrous second season starring Colin Farrell. But there's life in this show yet, so long as the story's tied to a mesmerizing performance by a master actor playing a singular character."
The Thing About Pam,0,"Overall, The Thing About Pam feels lackluster and gaudy, with zero care for the victims and treatment of Pam as if she’s a celebrity for a good reason."
Normal People,1,It is moving like few other dramas achieve.
For All Mankind,1,For All Mankind remains competence porn of the highest order -- and the best show you’re probably not watching.
Hacks,1,If the thrill of devouring Hacks’ first season can’t be fully replicated here -- and that’d be a high bar for any show that was so assured and exciting right out the gate -- it’s refreshing to see it still strike the right balance of humor and heart.
Mr. Corman,0,"Because Josh is such a drag, and so generally one-note about it, even the show's more impressive Walter Mitty-ish flights of fancy ring hollow. They look cool, but in service to a thin, frustrating protagonist."
Lisey's Story,1,"Julianne Moore is engrossing as the titular Lisey, a woman adrift since Scott died two years ago."
Ozark,1,The Byrdes' risky adventures in money laundering continue to captivate as the Netflix show nears its end.
Banshee,1,The series remains the best action show on TV by far.
After Life,1,"It is by turns outrageous, uplifting, unflinching, sad, hilarious and angry."
Schmigadoon!,1,Schmigadoon! is a hoot -- an inventive and thoroughly enjoyable summer delight.
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider is deluxe King, befitting a tall tale that gains imaginative power by slowly weaving its spooky and supernatural elements into a gripping detective story. It all feels so real-until it doesn't."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Purists may complain about the recreated basketball, but that misses the point. What’s important here is the life the series portrays, the go-go-go 1980s NBA scene the Lakers helped usher in."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is clearly not a cheap production. Every scene is eye-pleasing, a feast of color and pattern, fashion and scenery."
Attack on Titan,1,"Te final season's premiere continues Attack on Titan's deft focus on the no-win hell that is war, and while fans may miss those familiar faces, the new additions to the cast and their side of the story are sure to impress."
Moon Knight,1,"This show is built for both longtime fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and newcomers to the House of Ideas heroes, and its off to a great start."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"It’s not quite as rich as the other new Connelly show Bosch: Legacy, but it’s a solid courtroom drama/detective show -- the closest thing streaming has to Law & Order."
Warehouse 13,1,"Like all good installments of Warehouse 13, it is the smaller moments that make the show so much fun. Pete's constant need for a snack and thinking about food are still out in force, and the banter between Steve and Claudia is even more sarcastic."
Unbelievable,1,"The most standout aspect of Unbelievable, though, is that it shines light on survivors and heroes, rather than dwelling upon the psyches of perpetrators of violent crimes."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable might be the first cop show to focus not on how ""impartial objectivity"" is the only way to handle an investigation, but how much that objectivity can actually f*ck it."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Moreish, searing, excellent. What it is not is nuanced."
Watchmen,1,"Johnson was craggily charismatic. King was brilliantly fiery. The actions scenes thrilled, the rest intrigued and killing off a major character straight away was a bold way to grab attention. Has Watchmen's hour of screen glory finally arrived?"
Fargo,1,"Series creator Noah Hawley has come up with yet another ambitious, dazzling, and entertaining season of his Coen brothers-based anthology series, this time with a story that brings in themes of racism, assimilation, and the fraught promise of America."
Lisey's Story,1,"For all its faults, the miniseries has a shockingly good cast, making clunky dialogue sound almost natural, and rising to and often above the material in ways which, at best, feel legitimately transformative."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Like the seasons that came before it, this run of Jessica Jones is good but nowhere near great."
Dark Winds,1,This is an atmospheric crime thriller with real potential.
Chernobyl,1,"We may no longer be in Gorbachev's USSR, but we're just worshipping different masters now, the show seems to say. Some of them have orange skin, others wear orange clothes."
Godless,1,"For as much as Griffin's prophecy hang over the show, Godless expands in many different directions over its seven-episode sprawl"
Man vs. Bee,1,"As you’d expect from a Netflix production, it’s smartly produced and directed, and Atkinson as Bingley is much more engaging than Bean, and is still game enough to spend much of his time on screen in his underpants."
Six Feet Under,1,Six Feet Under is back for another season of harsh life lessons and deliciously dark humour. It has been far too long.
The Outsider,0,"There are a lot of cracks in The Outsider, and not even the glue provided by great acting and skilled directing can completely fill them."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Stick around for the marvellous cast of characters, both the sad and funny ones. As Moiraine, Pike is very stately and you get the feeling there is more to this woman than the speeches and her grave gaze on the world."
Chernobyl,1,"The gripping five-part miniseries, Chernobyl, manages to viscerally recreate it - the horror, heroism and sheer folly of it all."
Reacher,1,"Call me retrograde, but I found Reacher entertaining. It clips right along, is reasonably suspenseful and has a vivid cast."
Foundation,0,"A forced, utterly humorless march into sci-fi history."
BoJack Horseman,1,"What follows is a standout season where the typically inward-facing show turns outward, widening the lens to ask what we owe one another."
The Wilds,1,"While The Wilds might be ""kids survive a plane crash"" lite, it's actually more zany than ""Yellowjackets."" If that's your cup of herbal tea, you've struck gold."
Peacemaker,1,"The show's more modest settings allow the audience to concentrate on its characters, and its sub-blockbuster production values don't preclude it from boasting its fair share of absurd action sequences..."
The Wonder Years,1,"Thankfully, this version of ""The Wonder Years"" makes you want to follow this kid on this journey of realization and understanding."
Shining Girls,1,"While the Apple TV+ series certainly merits fair warning for its mature themes, learning too much about its premise may detract from its rewarding twists and turns"
Mad Men,1,It's fantastic to have this conversation piece back on a weekly basis.
BoJack Horseman,1,"For now, the series leaves viewers to contemplate the problem for themselves. Based on his arc over these eight episodes, I'm convinced: Against all odds, BoJack has changed."
Titans,1,"Busy as Titans already is with its proper members, pulling that sort of storytelling here might be a challenge that the series isn't quite yet up to, though."
Slow Horses,1,"Boasting a slew of crackerjack actors, this six-part thriller makes an excellent introduction to Herron's gleefully corrosive vision of British intelligence — and of present-day Britain."
Succession,1,"Crass and crude as ever, it's a delight to return to the filth of Succession."
What If...?,1,"The episodes are short and sweet, and they bring with them intriguing ideas ... some of which I hope end up affecting the MCU movies. [Full review in Spanish]"
Stranger Things,1,"Born in 1984, the Duffer Brothers have an uncanny grasp of what was happening during their toddlerhood and can locate the charm in pop cheesiness. This makes for era-specific comic relief that’s also timeless."
Defending Jacob,1,"What really hooks you are the relatable characters, superbly played by the terrific cast. Come for the mystery, stay for the drama. [Full review in Spanish]"
Looking for Alaska,1,"With eight episodes, there's rarely a character who doesn't get to reveal some more vulnerable layer. These cracks in the veneer sometimes take too long to show themselves, but they're always welcome."
Shadow and Bone,0,"The maddening thing is that when you actually understand what is happening in ""Shadow,"" there is some really good TV there."
Hawkeye,1,"More exceptional Marvel and Disney excitement. All said, Jeremy Renner did a great job, as did Hailee Steinfeld, but the truest bit of excitement for me was when Native actress Alaqua Cox made it on screen. An appreciative shout to Zahn McClarnon as well."
Inventing Anna,1,"The plot of Inventing Anna can feel a bit convoluted at times, but all the various jigsaw pieces of the story come together in a satisfying way by the end, albeit some more interesting and outrageous than others."
Devs,1,"A quite fascinating, hypnotic series, with a couple of quite amazing moments and, in general, recommendable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Landscapers,1,"It may be a little artsy for those seeking a straight-up mystery, but Colman and co-star David Thewlis are both terrific."
Invincible,1,"What both anchors and keeps Invincible compelling is its cast, packed to the brim with talent. As Mark, Yeun conveys a perfect combination of teenage insecurity, determination and occasional arrogance."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"A story that addresses all of its issues with depth, consideration, and elegance. [Full review in Spanish]"
Boardwalk Empire,1,Boardwalk Empire's final bow is a brilliant conclusion to the series. [Full Review in Spanish]
Homeland,0,"The pacing for the whole season was completely off, an issue that became far more of a problem as Carrie and Saul returned to America."
13 Reasons Why,0,The team behind 13 Reasons Why had no way of knowing that audiences would be watching this season in the middle of a pandemic. But that only makes the sadistic nature of the material that much more glaring.
The Offer,1,"All criticisms – and there are many – aside, the Offer remains watchable to the bloated end."
Monsters at Work,1,Monsters at Work is a wonderful addition to the Monstroplis mythos. It's filled with plenty of laughs and memorable new characters that are sure to excite fans new and old.
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter remains one of Marvel's strongest TV properties.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Aside from a few misfires, the series delivers a solid glance at the larger world Vought's manufactured heroes exist in, offer a few insights into key characters, and delivers something that even the most casual of The Boys viewer can enjoy."
Minx,1,"""Minx"" bets big on cocks of all sizes in its saga of feminism and full-frontal at an erotic magazine for women."
Hellbound,1,"All in all, Hellbound is an intriguing, albeit unfocused series with a solid hook."
Supernatural,1,"Supernatural's season fifteen premiere is an enjoyable, action-packed affair which doesn't exactly make it clear where things are going from here but still points to it being a fun, final ride for the Winchesters."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"If youre a fan of the era or love looking back on how the tectonic plates of music shifted to produce some of the mediums defining works, youll dive in swimmingly."
The Capture,1,"This thoughtful but still thrilling series is a worthwhile watch that may leave you a little shaken, wanting to make sure your computer cameras are covered ... just in case."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"With the episodes clocking in around the half-hour mark, you will likely breeze through this story and not feel the need to come back week after week. It may just be worth a binge once the whole season has aired on Disney+."
Bodyguard,1,"To watch Bodyguard's six episodes is to suspend disbelief and submit to its surprises. It helps not to expect too much more than that, particularly when it comes to the show's lavish employment of archetypes."
The Undoing,0,It's the kind of mottled prestige drama that's urgent but without purpose -- like a toy that's been wound-up and keeps jumping around until the mechanism is exhausted.
Better Things,1,"If you haven’t watched before, now is the time."
Silicon Valley,1,"Given the hoopla that tends to surround such farewells, it doesn't feel like Silicon Valley is going out with a bang. Yet if the series wasn't necessarily a killer app, it was, right up until the end, an extremely well-designed program."
Limitless,1,The show is definitely in the hands of those with a solid enough track record to believe it will settle into a nice rhythm at CBS.
Invincible,1,"With a great voice cast led by Oscar nominee Steven Yeun, this animated series does justice to Robert Kirkman's superhero comics."
Godless,1,"Don't get me wrong--Godless is a spectacular show, and well worth watching...But still, it feels like a missed opportunity to have built up the conceit of a ""no man's land"" ruled by women, and fail to deliver on the feminism."
Chappelle's Show,1,"A fascinating, brilliant, and sometimes maddening collection of three episodes cobbled together, Frankenstein-style, from skits Chappelle made before he famously ditched his show and fled to Africa."
Chuck,1,I'm glad that Chuck is back
The Essex Serpent,1,"""Serpent"" ultimately draws you in with deeply-felt performances which tease out the inner lives of the characters, building up to an understated but intense and cathartic resolution. It would undoubtedly repay multiple viewings."
Y: The Last Man,1,What makes the FX production stand out is writing that rises it above the genre origins.
Shadow and Bone,1,The first season of SHADOW AND BONE will satisfy both fans of the Grishaverse novels and make converts of newcomers.
Looking for Alaska,1,"Not only does the adaptation capture the nostalgic feeling of reading the novel for the first time (say at 15, awkward and lovelorn), it handles tragedy much more delicately and naturally than other teen series in recent years."
Midnight Mass,1,"The Netflix series deserves praise for its distinctive ambitions and jolting surprises but too often plays like a long-winded sermon, frittering around the edges of its homily."
Hacks,1,"As with the first season, the ice-cold, fire-warm heart and soul of Hacks lies in the relationship between Deborah and Ava."
Little Voice,1,"I can't deny that ""overly earnest"" is far from my preferred love language and that Little Voice made me cringe frequently... I also can't deny that the show left me humming several tunes and that, in at least one moment, it induced blubbering."
Bridgerton,0,"Aren’t these boring statements of morality the exact thing last season flouted with its copious, luxuriant shots? Bridgerton, it’s like I don’t even know you anymore!"
Coyote,1,"We'll give Coyote the benefit of the doubt, given the presence of both Chiklis and MacLaren."
Station Eleven,1,"On the style-substance spectrum, ""Station Eleven"" registers as a flawed but engrossing work whose narrative imperfections are masked by the considerable craft of its execution."
The Leftovers,1,This spiritually shaking psychological drama promises more existential crises than enlightened answers.
Foundation,0,"By keeping the audience at arm's length, Foundation also makes it that much harder to connect with any of the characters, despite some solid performances from the entire cast."
Moon Knight,1,"There's action… lots of humor, and a lead doing extraordinary work in a double role.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Acapulco,1,"On paper, this might not sound like a whole lot of fun. But Acapulco boasts enough sharp characterizations to make its gentle screwball comedy ping pong around the hotel with effervescent ease."
Devs,1,"You would go into scenes genuinely unsure of their outcome, then realize Garland has led you to that single point all along. He makes the eight hours feel like an extended piece, flecked with cosmic wonder."
Castle Rock,1,"One episode in, this season of Castle Rock is pulpy in a way season one didn't attempt. It's quick and sharp and tense and breathless."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's a terrific documentary portrait, butstrangely, it might have benefitted from there being somewhat less of it."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Jonathan Levine adds little to the soapiness of the tale, despite some coolly elegant compositions from cinematographer Yves Belanger, who also shot Big Little Lies. Disappointing indeed."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"This is the horror series you never knew you needed. A beautifully-cast show that plays out like Six Feet Under meets The Conjuring, there is simply nothing else like it."
Hawkeye,1,"While Hawkeye doesn't feel like anything particularly special within the larger MCU, it provides a few thrills as well as strong introductions to several characters who hopefully shine better once they take center-stage in their own stories."
Black Mirror,1,"As the world around us becomes more and more unstable, Black Mirror now finds itself in a precarious position. How can your dystopian sci-fi show compete with the actual impending actual dystopia?"
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It might rival The Beatles' entire catalogue for runtime, but Fabs fans will wish this wondrous mega-doc went on forever"
Landscapers,1,"Though this theatrical style has the effect of making a few of Colman and Thewlis' lines and delivery feel extremely staged, the two lead actors are nothing short of phenomenal in what could have been two very boring roles."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The end result is that a show like this can come back and be satisfying, again and again, without either gambling on a cliffhanger or having to start entirely from scratch."
Moon Knight,1,"Watching Moon Knights first 4 episodes, I kept on thinking of FXs Legion and the 90s classic: The Mummy. diandrareviews"
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Marvel and Netflix's ability to hold steady a show revolving around a character that most Americans would consider a nightmare is impressive, and requires a very strict rulebook."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Seeing all the pieces line up, it's as if they'd been planning this and exactly this from the very beginning."
The Boys,1,Amazon Studios has obviously given the production a budget worthy of creating gory/bloody masterpieces.
The Ipcress File,1,"It is satisfying to see spying represented in such cartoonish colours, as well as a rose-tinted retrospection on the red scare."
Slow Horses,1,"Consistently maintains its tension, while hitting its mark to make you laugh.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Girls,1,"It's been witty and inventive, ugly and ridiculous. It juggles despair and dark humour with deceptive dexterity. It has moments that are breathtakingly confident."
The Owl House,1,"Despite its momentum being noticeably cut off at the knees, The Owl House is still worth watching, if only because it’s impressive how much it’s been able to pull off with its short existence."
Inventing Anna,1,"Thoroughly entertaining thanks to a wealth of Manhattan elites who fell for Delvey’s schtick, Inventing Anna proves an addictive, who-is-she? riff on the whodunit."
The OA,1,"This series has never been meant for everyone, but for those who are true believers in the OA, Part II will be a welcome follow-up to the first."
Pieces of Her,0,"Collette is captivating as usual, but the same cant be said for the story. Featuring more than a few exposition-filled moments and strange decisions, it never fully comes together."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects emphasises the suffocating nature of small town life, especially when laced with fear and suspicion."
Russian Doll,1,"Natasha Lyonne is always entertaining to watch, but Russian Doll feels less special the second time around."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Somewhere deep down, you always knew this would come back to haunt him."
Peacemaker,1,"If you couldve told me Book of Boba Fett, particularly after the terrific The Mandalorian, was going to pale in comparison to HBO Maxs The Peacemaker series, Id have forced you into the cold shower to help you ween off the drugs."
The Outsider,1,"It's King's oeuvre as we've never seen it done before, with moody camerawork, taut scripts, and what at first appears to be a complete genre shift for the Master of Horror."
Squid Game,0,Craptacular.
WandaVision,1,"Based on these two episodes, there's enough reason to be optimistic that WandaVision might just be genuinely weird enough."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit probably could have wrapped in six episodes, but when a show's world is rendered so beautifully, you won't mind a little extra time to look around."
One of Us Is Lying,1,"One of Us Is Lying has potential and good actors. Restraint, however, continues to bog it down in the first three episodes."
Six Feet Under,1,The series (which underwent a creative resurrection this season) should go down in history as having the least nostalgia-laden finale in TV history.
Harlots,1,"In a world of arson, hangings, incest, bare-knuckle boxing, molly houses and murderous cults, the fact that Harlots still manages to keep its viewers on their toes is a true testament to its greatness."
Once Upon a Time,0,"The curse in Hyperion Heights feels a bit too forced while the alternate lives of Regina, Rumple and Hook seemed a bit uninspired and, honestly, not all that interesting."
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks and Geeks finds abundant humor in the absurdity of the situations the characters face.
Westworld,1,At least this feels a bit more like Westworld when it was actually good.
Cowboy Bebop,1,"The characters in Cowboy Bebop are engaging, mysterious, and likable misfits one can easily sympathize with... Having one of the best English dubs out there, Cowboy Bebop is an excellent first anime."
Shadow and Bone,1,"The various details and peculiarities we find in the story make this series something exceptional, at least in its first season. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Gilded Age,1,"There's a certain comforting familiarity to The Gilded Age, and Fellowes remains adept at juggling a large cast and making an addictive drama out of the haughty concerns of the ultra-wealthy."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"Kapadia rightly decides that actions speak louder than age-worn portraits, and the result is some often magical twinning of words and image."
Monsters at Work,1,Monsters at Work is a gently amusing production that provides more nuance and charm than expected.
Sex Education,1,"Quietly subversive, proudly progressive, and blessed with a delicate, empathic tone; Netflix's deceptively titled show remains wildly stimulating."
The Stand,0,"That conflicted quality makes the danger faced by the community serving as humanity's last stand curiously subdued, and ""The Stand"" struggles to distinguish itself outside of its exceptional casting choices."
Succession,1,"So far, at any rate, Succession's latest season is certainly off the hook - a real good job do-er, full of little Machiavellian f***s, and funny enough to leave viewers laughing as if they grew up on a hyena farm."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"If you are a romantic, you'll love Once in Wonderland. If not, expect a lot of eye rolling in between the good parts... But some flashes of wit, imagination, and goofy-but-fun action hint that it may end up being worth the ride."
The Good Place,1,"After a bit of a muddled end to season three, The Good Place began moving all of the pieces into place for the final season with an excellent opener to season 4."
Bridgerton,1,"Season 2 does a fine job of keeping fans gleeful while being much more probing and, in the end, quite superior to the first season."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"The sixth and final season of the series delivers happy endings all around, as if rewarding viewers for their devotion to the lives of the wealthy and the service classes alike."
The Office,1,"As the series comes to an end, I almost feel like I'm losing some of my best ""friends""."
Trying,1,"It's simply a wonderful series from top to bottom, and this new season is its best outing yet. You'll adore it."
Stranger Things,1,The Duffer brothers deliver another addictive outing..the series forges a new and notably darker path.
Sex and the City,1,"SATC undercut the portrayal of women as catty and petty [...]. It helped to pave the way for ensemble shows like Girls, Broad City and Insecure, which portray complex women and their relationships sympathetically."
Monk,0,"The finale summed up the reasons why lots of people loved this series, and why I and other people thought it had all become repetitive and silly."
Parenthood,1,"Welcome back, Parenthood. I'm so glad you're still here."
Counterpart,1,"The story that ""Twin Cities"" tells is one that someone who's never seen a single episode of Counterpart could appreciate."
The Sinner,1,"It would be nice if this trip allowed Harry to heal from the Jamie-induced trauma. He needs a win, but something tells me that he will not be Percy's savior, no matter how badly everyone wishes it could be true."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,His (Director Kief Davidson) team also does what Stewart's publisher... apparently never did: fact-check his assertions. It's in those verifications that the documentary justifies its existence.
BoJack Horseman,1,"In some of the new season's most affecting scenes, BoJack shows Princess Carolyn literally fragmenting herself to get through her daily routine... BoJack seems to understand how performative the job of trying to ""have it all"" or ""do it all"" can be."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,I think the real charm of both this series and the original - and the secret to their success - is that they tell us that even people who seem to have the most charmed lives are really just as troubled and confused as the rest of us.
Better Things,1,I want to protect this woman I do not know who may not even need my protection. And I want to believe that the stories she puts on screen are both relatable and uniquely her own voice.
The Expanse,1,"""The Expanse is a once-in-a-lifetime series ... The curators of this show bless us with six consistently incredible seasons, rich with intricate sci-fi magic, tour de force performances, stunning visuals, and a gripping story."""
"Love, Victor",1,"Last episode was pretty sparse, but this time, we’ve got a bit of everything."
Departure,0,"Departure Season 2 is, unfortunately, an over-complicated mess that loses sight of what made Departure Season 1 so wonderful."
Peaky Blinders,1,"This was the Peaky Blinders we have fallen in love with over the past nine years -- a dark, gloomy, tense, intricately planned (but never too complicated) show, full of exceptional performances and the underhand machinations of a loveable rogue gangster."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Better still, the now-expected midseason side quest finally pays off..."
Man vs. Bee,0,"It’s always a bad sign when a comedian resorts to dog doody for a laugh, yet that’s the level Rowan Atkinson sinks to here. And he doesn’t step in it, he face-plants it. This, from the guy who gave us Mr Bean and Blackadder? That's not funny. That’s sad."
Chernobyl,1,"Silence, on Chernobyl, becomes a killer and it's why this miniseries exists: to speak up so disasters like Chernobyl don't happen again."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"May not be enough to entice you to make a five-week commitment to ""Scenes,"" but don't make that call before at least saying ""I do"" to the premiere."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"From the start, Only Murders in the Building stood out as a generous series with a lot of heart. It’s beating more joyously than ever second time around."
Heartstopper,1,"The style of the series may be nothing new—animated leaves, hearts, and sparks swoop around lovestruck characters like generic indie fare, the sad ballads drive one montage after the next—but there is plenty that is refreshing about how it’s all told."
The Outsider,1,"A show about loss, grief and the limits of belief. Wonderfully executed by an admirable cast. [Full review in Spanish]."
Sex Education,1,"In its third outing, the series remains cringingly honest and engagingly heartfelt, with just the right amount of pathos and the occasional outrageous sight gag."
Mindhunter,1,"Atmospheric and chilling as ever - generally without being gory beyond clinical crime scene still photos - ""Mindhunter"" remains one of the current era's best series."
Loki,1,"Loki has a lot of potential, but in the first two episodes at least, a sluggish narrative and four phases worth of back story weigh things down more than we'd like."
The Witcher,1,"Sadly, though Season 2 continues ... stories of all our beloved characters in sometimes satisfying ways, it does so in a far less experimental manner, and suffers because of it."
Bel-Air,1,"There are no weak spots in the cast; everyone brings the right authority to their role. Most crucial of course is newcomer Banks, an excellent selection."
The Fall,0,It's a frustrating end to a frustrating season.
The Fall,1,"Season 3 does a passable job ending the story, but you have to watch the other seasons first."
Squid Game,1,Is there a battle more emblematic of this moment than that between individual rights and social responsibilities?
Severance,1,"Written and created by Dan Erickson with episodes directed by Ben Stiller, there’s a dark humor, absurdist vibe that, alongside the mysteries, makes Severance appealing. But some of that interest gets undone by over-long episodes and a thudding pace."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"[The finale] doesn't create needless drama or focus on characters we don't care about. It zeroes in on the core four (with Howard, Bernadette and Raj as back-up) and gives them the episodic equivalent of a long, warm hug."
Moon Knight,1,"Whatever the case, he’s terrific fun to watch. If anything, Moon Knight works far better as a virtuoso acting display by Isaac than as a satisfactory story."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a frequently scary, surprisingly emotional saga focused on both past and present. Director Mike Flanagan takes Shirley Jackson's iconic haunted house novel and works into something wholly different, yet equally effective."
The Bletchley Circle,1,"The mysteries [the characters] take on are often related to a personal relationship for at least one of the women, and in turn, it heightens the tension and the stakes for them all."
The Gilded Age,1,"If you're normally enamored with period dramas, Masterpiece on PBS, or well-orchestrated ensemble pieces, The Gilded Age should provide plenty of entertainment in the weeks to come."
The Nevers,0,"""The Nevers,"" while handsomely produced and, from moment to moment, reasonably diverting, doesn't catch fire in those early episodes in part because we - along with the characters - are still trying to figure out what the heck is going on."
Mad Men,1,It will cost a lot to fill the gap left by Mad Men. [Full Review in Spanish]
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers with Kidman in the lead has a stellar cast of talented actors, but there's less going on with this story than the trailer (edited as a scary story) implies."
The Shrink Next Door,1,The Shrink Next Door is a disturbing and tragic story of trust being abused. It explores the dark side of greed and manipulation.
The Stand,1,"For the most part, it's time well spent."
Counterpart,1,"Beyond its artfully chilly atmosphere and its surprisingly plausible and suspenseful narrative, the main attraction in Season 2 remains J.K. Simmons's crafty, quiet portrayal of the two spies."
Marvel's 616,1,"An absolutely wonderful look into the world of Marvel, touching on so many areas of the company that often don't get the showcase they deserve - from the mainstream to the absolutely wacky and absurd."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"But more important than fidelity to the source material is the result. In that, Season 3 excels, with the six episodes provided for review representing the best of the series, and, arguably, of Netflix's corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Shining Girls,0,"To me this is contrived and exploitative. Also, I feel as though I’ve seen a lot of it before."
The Office,1,"The Office opened back up for business Thursday, and it looks like business is, once again, good."
Devs,1,Thankfully Devs presents these mindbending ideas in a hugely entertaining and thrilling fashion.
Irma Vep,1,"Irma Vep takes a bit too long setting the table before getting to the meat of this adaptation, but once it gets going in the third episode, Assayas is crafting a remarkably personal and shockingly honest look at art and himself."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"What I consider the best Disney Channel original program ever, Lizzie dealt with a myriad of middle school problems."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's part religious thinkpiece, part pure horror as its finest. It's also a rare case where, while at times the one-hour episode runtime feels slightly too long, it ultimately pays off in a sensational way."
Swagger,0,"For the most part, it plays more like a second-tier series than a blue-chip one."
For All Mankind,1,"In the endless barrage of mediocre series pushed out weekly, ""Mankind"" stands out, a shining star (or moon or planet) among the replaceable rest."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"It is probably intended to make you want to go back and watch the whole series again with fresh eyes (remember the title?). The only problem is, the run up is so ponderous you might not even make it as far as the twist in the first place."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff makes a lot of expected choices and covers a lot of expected ground... this is not a NASA story that ever takes its eye off the white men at the center of its story for very long.
Yellowjackets,1,Genuinely frightening and thoroughly unmissable.
The Adventures of Merlin,1,"The Merlin finale had all of the ingredients of a great ending: an epic battle, a leader making the ultimate sacrifice for his people and the triumph of good over evil."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game culminates emotionally in episode six, centered on a childlike game of marbles that's paced with excruciating slowness as the main characters have to make, literally, life or death decisions with one another."
The Shrink Next Door,1,There is solid acting from these two performers as well as the supporting cast best known for their comedic work but it is buried under too much filler.
Amazing Stories,1,"It's an unfashionable approach, of course, and maybe it does sit a little oddly with Apple's image and positioning as a new and thrusting arrival on the streaming scene. But you don't recruit Spielberg if you aren't looking for a product with heart."
Younger,0,"The most overwhelming emotion I feel is relief. The last season, number seven, was pretty excruciating."
Black Sails,1,Manages to walk a delicate line between relying too heavily on the story to come and winking at viewers who might be looking for the occasional easter egg.
Bodyguard,0,The result is a fatally broken series - it starts very well and goes off the rails in its last episodes - but it is blatantly visible that it offers the same discourse as the cinema of the 70s: the institutions are rotten. [Full Review in Spanish]
Star Wars: Visions,1,"If Star Wars films are going to keep edging closer and closer to shonen anime anyway, they may as well let the masters have a turn."
Earth to Ned,1,"If The Muppet Show helped '70s America rediscover irreverent joy, Earth to Ned might be here to convince 2020 America that our world is worth saving."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Knowing BoJack Horseman is coming to an end is painful enough, and these eight episodes do make an effort to smooth the edges off that sadness."
Reacher,1,Reacher doesn't commit to that fun side of the character as much as it could.
Defending Jacob,0,"In the pantheon of Massachusetts-set entertainments, ""Defending Jacob"" falls somewhere between Mark Wahlberg's godawful ""Spenser Confidential"" and Kenneth Lonergan's flawless ""Manchester by the Sea."""
Loki,1,"With LOKI, the MCU seems to be going for THE ODD COUPLE by way of ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND...as much character study as a dissertation on society. It's hardly kids' stuff."
Sharp Objects,0,"Frustratingly opaque, and it moves like molasses."
Schmigadoon!,0,"What seems like a strength at first, of having every song and dance as a full production number, quickly becomes wearing after the initial impressiveness wears off."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's all still amusing, and the notes of strangled romanticism and just-perceptible nobility are still in place. But the plot doesn't have the momentum and the crazy energy it did the first time around."
Long Way Up,1,Electric motorcycles prove to be a challenge in the entertaining and highly enjoyable third chapter of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's travel series that'll please fans looking for adventure.
Somebody Somewhere,1,Bridget Everett’s subtle and charming performance is just one reason we like Somebody Somewhere. The first episode also does a good job setting up a great ensemble that we look forward to getting to know.
Sex Education,1,In Season 3 Lily is not just a joke; she's simply a person who can't help being herself. Reynolds has previously been a strong comedic player but here she finally gets to show her capability for dramatic depth.
Two and a Half Men,1,"Whether you liked the finale or not, the show doesn't care. It, and Chuck Lorre, went out on the exact notes it wanted to end. And that note, as far as Lorre was concerned, was a #winning one."
Killing It,0,"Unfortunately, [Killing It] is no Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It doesn’t have the snap, crackle and pop in the dialogue, the density of gags, the brilliantly drawn characters or the magic casting."
Invincible,1,"This superhero show may play it a bit safer than The Boys, which won't help it stand out in the current landscape of superhero content, but for now, it works and should satisfy fans of the comic, even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel."
Chernobyl,1,Objectivity is Chernobyl's best ally. This is the best thing I watched in the entire year of 2019. [Full review in Spanish]
Normal People,1,"It has the confidence to stay close to its pair, excise all the extraneous, and keep us rooting for this fascinating couple on their extraordinary journey of self-discovery, friendship, and love."
Hawkeye,1,"Taken by itself, Hawkeye is a perfectly serviceable action romp. But when there's so many of these things saturating the market, it needs to work a little harder to justify its own existence."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's bleak, vodka-fuelled, and I suspect it might become magnificent in its study of small-town denials, and how they fester only to erupt, decades later, like the blackest of buboes."
Treadstone,0,"On a technical level, Treadstone has a lot going for it. The action quality is there. The bombastic energy is there. The espionage element is there. But, the show really needs to shed its unwillingness to be a part of the universe audiences know and love."
Taboo,1,"Taboo's gruff and tough and silly, and I'm hooked."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The cast of the series is very diverse, but the storyline itself is only intermittently progressive."
Preacher,1,"Hopefully, Preacher will wrap up successfully, and keep on finding new ways to offend as many people as possible. But the feeling is certainly that it's time to let the show go. The end? It's arriving just in time, almost."
The Stranger,1,"The Stranger is a lot like most decent mystery novels: Entertaining, but meant to be consumed not remembered."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"This is Going to Hurt sometimes feels like a howl of despair beneath its quippy veneer. Luckily, the howler is played by Whishaw, who has practically has a PhD in playing fragile characters."
The Wheel of Time,1,"There are a fair share of lingering questions that will frustrate fans but keep them engaged in the episodes to come. The world is vast, and this series is on its way to become one that everyone is talking about."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"While there is a sameness to all three of Kidman's most recent TV/streaming projects, there's no denying they're addictive soaps. Nine Perfect Strangers benefits tremendously from Hall playing against type and the presence of McCarthy."
American Auto,1,"It's smart and very funny after only three episodes, so if it gets an opportunity at a second season, I can only see it getting better."
Big Little Lies,1,"It's a visual idiom that sure sizzles, making the natural setting and the homes both captivating and unnerving. What is also here in the continuation is a fabulous sense of humour. There are scenes of exquisite dry hilarity."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The characters simply don't possess enough pop to draw in those who don't come immersed in the mythology, and the special effects are uneven."
Monsters at Work,1,"A smart, sassy and surprisingly effective update of the now 20-year-old minor animated classic."
Wolf Like Me,1,Isla Fisher's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
Hannibal,1,"From the European-flavored surrealist horror of the first half of the season to the slow-simmering brutality of the back half, Bryan Fuller has not only expertly crafted the perfect ending, but also one of the greatest love stories of contemporary TV."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"It's loop-the-loop loopy, but also exciting; the fun Fellowes is having is infectious."
The Undoing,0,"No matter how much you crave kitchen islands, beige cashmere and Central Park in the snow, I'd be willing to bet you won't want to keep watching The Undoing beyond episode two."
Fleabag,1,'Fleabag' has hit me the way the best books do. [Full Review in Spanish]
Reacher,1,It is safe to say that ‘Reacher’—both the character and this series— is your quintessential modern-day hero.
Mad Men,1,"The writing, by Weiner, direction by Scott Hornbacher and performances are, of course, top-notch."
WandaVision,1,"She's not the first superhero to be affected acutely by emotional pain; everyone knows that quote about great power and great responsibility. Yet for an MCU project, the choice to focus on Wanda's inner life is revolutionary."
Sharp Objects,1,"Everything Big Little Lies did to embrace, dignify, and elevate the soap opera genre's female characters and tropes, Sharp Objects does with pulp mystery."
My Brilliant Friend,1,I hand it to series three of the TV adaptation with knobs on.
Peacemaker,1,"Butts get kicked, friendships are solidified, and we get the best joke in the DCEU to date."
Atlanta,1,It feels like we’ve lived seven lifetimes since this show last aired. It’s finally back.
Peacemaker,1,"Even if Brooks isn't meant to be the focus of a scene, she inevitably becomes it by the sheer force of her charisma. Making Brooks the co-lead of a high-octane, high stakes show like ""Peacemaker"" is frankly a no brainer."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, at its heart, has always been about testing what defines a hero - beneath the trappings of costumes and powers and tragic back-stories."
Unbelievable,1,"It's equally a sad and enraging look, fictionalised in terms of character names but otherwise faithful to the source material."
True Detective,0,"The criteria by which Season 3 should be judged is whether Pizzolatto lived up to his aspirations as an investigator of human nature. Really, he made a mildly engaging muddle."
Succession,1,"It may all be a play, but when the play is as nasty as this, it is impossible to look away."
Breaking Bad,1,The creeping sense of dread has been part of what has made Breaking Bad so engrossing.
Sweet Tooth,1,The performances are strong throughout -- Anozie is particularly remarkable -- but it's the consistently inventive writing and robust filmmaking that makes the project stand out.
Westworld,0,"It’s resolved to do what its done before to the best of its abilities, like a piece of A.I. tasked with replicating the human experience, but tapping out after it learns “excitement” and “deception.”"
Fleabag,1,"Throughout this magnificent second season, Fleabag buzzes with life."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,The season had something for everyone.
RENO 911!,1,"Sure, few would complain of getting more Reno, but the quick bites are just as indulgent as the show of yore with far less filler."
Hawkeye,1,"Peak performances from the cast, writing on full ignition, action that thrills, and a lot of room to tell what looks to be a fulfilling coming-of-age for one buddy and the reconciling of the past for the other. Die Hard and Lethal Weapon would be proud."
Counterpart,1,A strong start. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Mist,1,"The meaningful part of The Mist comes from the ways people falsely perceive each other, and hurt themselves in the process."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s garbage, but it’s high-end garbage and eminently binge-able. That kind of thing has its place."
True Detective,1,Saulnier doesn't entirely harken back to the swampy and sweaty mood of the first season but what he brings feels a bit closer to what once made True Detective great.
The Night Of,1,"From start to finish, The Night Of thrived on the strength of its actors, particularly Ahmed and Turturro."
Godless,1,"It feels nearly impossible to shake-up the genre, which I grew up watching thanks to my father, who is absolutely obsessed with throwback-ish style. And, yet, Netflix's new series Godless manages to do just that."
Loot,1,"Loot is a pleasant enough viewing experience, with a few sharp one-liners and a truly top-notch cast. But it’s also slightly disappointing, hampered by repetitive plot dynamics and a confused tone."
Stranger Things,1,"Season 4 Volume 1 is the most ambitious, suspenseful and bloody instalment of sci-fi horror yet from the Duffer Brothers."
Deadwood,1,"With assistance from some truly memorable acting by Ian McShane, Brad Dourif and Paula Malcomson, Deadwood's sometimes over-the-top representations never veer far enough from reality for its inhabitants to become just characters."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,I could show this to anybody... the accessibility level of this show is amazing.
The Right Stuff,0,"A tepid eight-part remake, originally announced for the National Geographic channel but now airing on Disney+, feels more like underpowered soap opera."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,The bluster and the questionable choices of where to focus too often overwhelm a unique context and well-intentioned discourse.
The Good Place,1,"The critical darling comedy's last run is jam-packed with all the creativity, wit and heart that have made the series a beloved fan favorite."
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,"Beyond issues of importance and representation, is the show good? Yes, though it’s not on the same level as other silly-spooky story-driven cartoons like Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and The Owl House."
Normal People,1,Normal People emerged as a naturalistic masterclass in emotional depth and cerebral elegance.
The First Lady,0,The First Lady is a barely thematically connected and carelessly staged summary of three fascinating figures. All of them deserved better.
The Great,1,"Season two of The Great is even stronger than season one, with better character beats and a greater reliance on humor."
The Outsider,1,Richard Price's adaptation... does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]
The Act,1,"The combination of subject and sequencing creates an eerie atmosphere, but pushing a bit further stylistically could have made this a campy treat instead of something caught between sincere storytelling and the bizarre true story."
Pachinko,1,"It’s a vast, sumptuous, dynastic political TV series of the kind scarcely made any more, complete with swooning strings from Nico Muhly’s score."
Yellowjackets,1,"Comparisons to Lord of the Flies might be inevitable considering the crux of the story, but where Yellowjackets succeeds as a survival drama is in the minutiae."
Big Little Lies,1,"The show appears to be exchanging an all-consuming, incendiary mystery for a tale that's less mercurial but no less hearty, and it's still an absolute pleasure to watch."
The Night Of,1,"It's brutal and brilliant, perhaps the best new TV series you'll see this summer."
Hawkeye,1,"""Hawkeye"" is a nice return to Earth after all the cosmic stuff we've seen lately. It's a reminder of why you fell in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the first place."
Suspicion,1,"If you get through the initial stodge, you'll find a tense, mindless thriller."
Reacher,1,The show’s real secret sauce though is in its character interactions and light touch.
Big Shot,1,"Big Shot is a slightly enjoyable sports drama anchored by a solid lead performance, but the acting can't rise too far above the writing. At least not yet."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Only Murders in the Building﻿ returns with much of what made season 1 so fun, yet also runs the risk of taking too much on for season 2."
